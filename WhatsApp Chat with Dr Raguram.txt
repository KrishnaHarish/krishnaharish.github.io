15/02/18, 3:27 pm - Nalini N R: Sir this is with reference to a patient Ranjini,32yrs referred by Dr. Satish Girimaji. She was seen by Dr. NJR, between 2010 to 2015, on medication for psychosis, Oleanz stopped in 2015. She did her BSc and later MSc in biotech though with difficulty. After graduation on the advice of some Counsellor got her married, but she ran back to her parent's place the very next day of marriage and later divorced. She tried but failed to continue with 3 to 4 jobs. Her daily routine was mainly sleeping, doing petty errands till she got married again to Srinivas who is coming to see you. He was taken to DR NJR before marriage who told him about her thought process. Right now over the past 2mths after marriage, husband complains about her negative symptoms slow to do work, dies not know cooking, value of things, not talking to people, withdrawn, preoccupied, asking 'silly' questions, not being romantic, may not be able to rear children etc. He appears to be forceful wants categorical answer how long she will take to become normal and that he finds it difficult to go on as he is already 40yrs old.

04/07/19, 10:44 am - Nalini N R: Welcome Sir.
10/07/19, 7:49 am - Dr Raguram: It is with a sense of deep dismay I have to share the sad news of the passing away of Dr GG Prabhu at Mysore. A person of exceptional importance and a colossus who shaped the discipline of clinical psychology in India. He was Ahalya's Phd guide and made it a point to attend the festschrift that was organized by the department on the occasion of her superannuation, in spite of his infirmities. We cherish our long association with this giant and warmly recollect the evening we spent with him in Mysore before we left for US. An irreplaceable loss personally and for the profession at large
10/07/19, 8:32 am - Nalini N R: Ohh. A very sad news Sir. We wanted to visit him last month but could not.  I keep recalling how he shaped us to be responsible while handling clients. Definitely we learnt lot of things. We we're really proud to know that we belonged to his department. May his soul  rest in peace.
10/07/19, 9:46 am - Nalini N R: It triggered off lot of conflicting feelings. Lot of things didn't fall into their places in my life. But a strong passion to continue in the field of Psychology made me go against family members when I kicked the Gov job and joined M.Phil was realised and I am so greatful to Prof.  Could not share the hurt which was hurled in the dept. because it was my decision. Previous night when Aditya passed away I had mentally felt hatred towards Prof as I used to be extremely anxious during his pregnancy. I felt like that probably it was a premonition and after all I am his mother. Aditya passed away on July 30th. It is important to work on the meaning of life and our 'selves' though it is like taking a 360 degree turn. Have been doing it. Sorry to bother you Sir. I felt like sharing which I don't usually do.
10/07/19, 9:52 am - Dr Raguram: Deeply appreciate it Nalini. Needless to say he had rough edges and often rode rough on them. On a larger canvas, the discipline of clinical psychology owes a lot to him for his dynamism to cleave a presence for the profession
10/07/19, 9:57 am - Nalini N R: Very very true Sir. I keep talking about it. And I will cherish the poisitives till I die. Discipline he taught I don't think anyone can.
10/07/19, 9:58 am - Dr Raguram: absolutely nalini
12/07/19, 7:07 pm - Nalini N R: Sir, we that is Uma, Kiran, Jamuna and myself went to Mysore to pay our last respects to professor GGP. It appeared that we represented NIMHANS and am sure Prof would have felt good since it was not a noisy gathering with just a handful of people apart from his children. We were present in the electric crematorium and bade him goodbye. May his soul rest in peace.
14/08/19, 6:39 am - Dr Raguram: There are moments in which you feel the urge to put into words experiences that are intangible.

11/08/20, 11:19 am - Dr Raguram: One of the commonest representations of Lord Krishna is Venugopala. 
Perhaps the finest depictions I have ever seen and that too in terracotta medium was in Bishnupur.  The temples walls of Bishnupur are extensively embellished with carved and molded terracotta decorations made from the locally available laterite clay. These temples are associated with the Gaudiya Vaishnava faith, dating back to seventeenth century. Understandably then the temple walls are covered with terracotta panels recounting the life and exploits of Krishna.
Among them is this exquisitely carved depiction of  Krishna playing the flute in the classic tribhanga pose, with gentle bends at the neck, waist and knee. He is surrounded by gopis who are entranced by his music, with peacocks and deer keeping them company. Do notice the finely chiseled carpet-like patterning of the terracotta facade of the entire façade of the temple.
What does the flute really signify? Hollow and empty, it does not produce any sound of its own. Travails we experience in life are like holes in the flute. We have to breathe life into it and let the melodious notes unfold…
11/08/20, 1:24 pm - Nalini N R: Truly fantastic intricate superb work to the extent it brings tears in eyes. Yes Sir. Everyone goes through tough times in their lives. But matterlies in the way we get around and look beyond. Your interpretation of holes and breath is worth giving a thought🤔
11/08/20, 1:24 pm - Dr Raguram: Thanks Nalini. Hope you are well and safe
11/08/20, 1:25 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. Thank you.

17/10/20, 9:50 am - Dr Raguram: Over the course of next few days I will be posting various depictions of Devi. Chalukyas were the forbears of South Indian sculptures traditions and were the first to
introduce the rock cut architectural tradition in South India. The Chalukyan artists were also the first in conceiving and depicting Mahishasuramardini in sculpturar form in South India.Here Mahishasuramardini is seen with four hands. Her lower left hand is holding the tail of the buffalo and with the trident on her lower right hand, she is piercing its head. One can clearly notice the spear going through the head of the buffalo. She is neither riding a tiger and nor is the asura depicted in human form. This is the sculptuea in Cave 1 at Badami
17/10/20, 10:34 am - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. And Lord Vishnu's Shanka and Chakra in two hands! Very nice. Will look forward to the other depictions.
18/10/20, 9:59 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
18/10/20, 9:59 am - Dr Raguram: Ravana Phadi cave temple was conceived at the same time like that of the cave temples of Badami. But here, the artisans have excelled themselves in creating a prototype of a regular temple by carving it into a huge sandstone boulder. There is a large plain field in front with a nandi facing the temple. Two pillared halls are on either side of the entrance. Once you ascend the steps and enter the cave one notices that the interiors are much larger than any other cave in Badami. All the walls of the cave have exquisite carvings and one among them is Mahishasuramardini. 
Here the goddess is portrayed with eight arms. With the weight of her left leg she is holding the buffalo demon Mahisha down, while spearing it with the trishula. On one of her left hands she is holding the head of the buffalo. She is also carrying a sword and a bow and is seen wearing an elaborate, conical crown. On her left one can spot a lion. Compared to the sculpture of Mahishasuramardini in Badami, here the goddess is more energetic and graceful.
Unfortunately ravages of time and vagaries of neglect have left their impact on this beautiful sculpture. An earlier sketch by an unknown draughtsman in 1853 will give an idea as to how gorgeous it would have been when it was sculpted. . .
18/10/20, 12:08 pm - Nalini N R: Very sad to see the distorted sculpture but the draftman's work helps us to go back to the time, imagine and appreciate the gracefulness of the sculpture.
20/10/20, 7:16 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
20/10/20, 7:16 am - Dr Raguram: Mahishasuramardini is often depicted standing on a decapitated buffalo head or in the act of killing it, from whose head a demon in the form of a man emerges. But the most vibrant depiction of the goddess is in an exquisite bas relief in a small cave in Mahabalipuram which depicts her in battle scene with Mahishasura. She is shown riding a prancing lion and holding various weapons in her eight hands, attacking the demon who is retreating from her onslaught, accepting his defeat. It is the finest depiction of the epic battle scene. I kept wondering as to what could have been the source of inspiration for this majestic creative art.
As I was exploring the Mallikarjuna temple in Pattadakkal, I was struck by a small panel, worn out with years, in a dark corner. In its miniature form it seemed to be a prototype for the grand battle scene at Mahabalipuram! The spirit of experimentation patronized by the Early Chalukya dynasty perhaps has been the source of inspiration for the sculptors to create a majestic, larger version at Mahabalipuram!
Though the Pallavas and Chalukyas have been known for their incessant rivalry, the wars between the two dynasties never came in-between the growth of rich cultural heritage. Their mutual exchange and influence of architectural styles can be seen in the beauty, rhythm and vigor captured in stone by their masterful craftsmen. The Mahishasuramardini panel in Pattadakkal and Mahabalipuram is the perfect example of this remarkable confluence.
21/10/20, 8:06 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
21/10/20, 8:07 am - Dr Raguram: DAY FIVE
The shore temple at Mahabalipuram dates back to 8th century and it is generally believed that it is actually a small part of a temple complex which existed eons ago. It demonstrates the progression of Pallava temple architecture from rock cut structures to free standing structural shrines. Though years of wind and erosion from sea water have worn away the details of many carvings, there is a strikingly large free standing sculpture of a lion on the southern side of the temple. It is actually a miniature temple! A carved alcove in its heart serves as the sanctum, within which is a carving of Mahishasuramardini.  The goddess is shown sitting astride triumphantly on the severed head of the buffalo demon. Two dwaraphalakis are carved on either side of the lion, clasping it. Mahishasuramardini is often portrayed riding a lion or a tiger. Here she has found a place in a lion’s heart! The Upanishadic concept that likens the heart to a cave within which resides a hidden self is emphasized here. Perhaps in portraying Mahshasuramardini in this form, the sculptors are conveying that within each of us is a heart of a lion where courage and power resides to vanquish negative forces!
21/10/20, 12:42 pm - Nalini N R: Sir you have a fantastic eye for details. The sculpture is so beautiful and the hands and legs are so slender and shapely! And the discovery you have made!
21/10/20, 12:48 pm - Nalini N R: Yes. Instead of just hailing the beauty of the sculpture, the interpretation that you have given is very apt. It boosts the spirit to fight.

22/10/20, 8:44 am - Dr Raguram: DAY 6
I relish discovering places and temples that are off the tourist radar.
Udaipur is not just about lakes and palaces. When I was there sometime back for a CME, after finishing my talk I enquired about a (unusually named) temple referred as Saasbahu temple. With some effort I found a local taxi driver who seemed to know the place, which was just an hour’s drive from Udaipur.
Located in the lap of the Aravalli mountain range, it was a charming structure by the side of a lake, surrounded by mustard fields. There was an aged guard who opened the gates and let me in. The early morning sun was playing hide and seek with the richly carved exterior of the temple
Built in the late 10th century, the larger temple (referred to as Saas) is surrounded by ten subsidiary shrines and is more profusely decorated than the smaller (Bahu) temple which has four shrines and an octagonal ceiling. The story goes that king Mahipala married a queen who was a devotee of Lord Vishnu and he constructed a temple dedicated to Vishnu for his wife to offer prayers. Years later, the king’s son married a princess who was devotee of Lord Shiva so he constructed another temple nearby for his daughter in law. Since the Vishnu temple was constructed first it was known as Sahastrabaahu temple meaning the lord with thousand arms though it included the Shiva temple as well. The name however got corrupted over a period of time to be called “Saas Bahu temple” much before the TV serial!
Made of granite, the carvings are quite remarkable and among them, this one of Mahishasuramardini caught my attention. Even though details of her face have been lost with the passage of time, the flowing lines enhance her graceful poise which is embellished with rich ornamentation. She is portrayed with a sword in her hand after killing the demon whose head is clearly seen on the ground. Though on a pragmatic level decapitation represents the loss of power, perhaps it is also a liberative act indicating that human pride and ego must be severed in order to attain salvation.
22/10/20, 10:33 am - Nalini N R: Thank you Sir for the rare journey into centuries old temples, which definitely have their own pure dedication to sculpture and vibrations. Yes, symbolic representation shouldn't be missed out.

Sometimes travelling in India is like a leap in the dark. One starts exploring destinations and discovering places which open up an entirely different world of experiences. My visit to Bhoramdeo was one such. While in Raipur for the Annual Conference of the Indian Psychiatric Society, I suddenly decided on a whim, to visit the place about which I had read a long while ago.
At first view, the temple stunned me. Set amidst a thick canopy of tall trees it was serenely beautiful. Soft morning rays of the winter sun dappled their way over the sal and bija leaves, setting the temple aglow with a golden lustre. The central tower composed of receding rows of exquisitely carved sculptures tapering upwards, seemed to replicate the receding hills of the Makali range in the background.
Dating back to the 7th century, it was Alexander Cunningham who discovered this temple which was engulfed by a dense forest, overgrown with vegetation. Taken aback by the sheer artistry of the temple he is said to have commented that ‘it is one of the most beautifully decorated temple seen by him.’ He also contended that it was originally dedicated to Vishnu and subsequently during the period of Gond supremacy in the region, the Vishnu idol was replaced with a Shivalinga in the sanctum. As the Gond tribals of the area worship Lord Shiva as Bhoramdeo, the temple was also named Bhoramdeo.
The outer walls of the temple were embellished with panel upon panel of delicate sculptures, covering a wide range of themes from the religious, the symbolic to the erotic. Because of the profusion of erotic sculptures and its structural similarity, it is often referred to as the “Khajuraho of Chattisgarh”. High up on the tower is a sculpture of Mahishasuramardini. Since it has been carved in chlorite stone, there has been considerable damage to the sculpture. In spite of it her face is serene and the ornamentation is exquisite.
Chipped, battered, broken, and yet elegant, its radiant beauty transcends its imperfection...
23/10/20, 10:04 am - Nalini N R: Sir thanks for giving us a chance to take a glimpse of the hidden treasure.

One of the most unusual Mahishasuramardini sculptures in India is this iconic Pallava creation at the Kailasanathar Temple at Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu. Constructed over a 20-year period from 685 to 705 CE, the Kailasanathar Temple is the first structural temple built by the Pallavas, after their earlier experiments with rock-cut temples at Mahabalipuram. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and named after his abode on Mount Kailash. There are two Mahishasuramardini sculptures: a larger one on the outer wall of the sanctum and a smaller one sculpted within one of the 58 miniature shrines that are built into the niches of the surrounding wall. Though smaller in size compared to other, it is exquisite.
Unlike the other Mahishasurmardini panels which we have seen so far, this one has no Mahishasura in the frame. Instead we see a triumphant Durga posing in the aftermath of her victory in a strikingly confident posture. Her left leg is placed on the back of the lion which is vividly sculpted. Her left hand is rests casually on the raised left knee. Her right hand is gripping her hip, and there is a noticeable bend at the waist which gives grace and movement to the whole sculpture. Notice the long bow held by her, which is taller than she is! These sculptures in the smaller shrines were once painted with vegetable dyes. One can notice the remnants of it on the wall behind. How resplendent she would have been at that time!
24/10/20, 10:45 am - Nalini N R: Oh what a beauty Sir and your description of the same leaves me speechless as there is nothing to add on. Fingers are exquisitely sculpted and the smile goes with her triumphant posture. It is a feast to the eyes. Wish you all a very happy Durgashtami.

After some fabulous birding at Mangalajodi in Orissa, I enquired at the place where I was staying as to whether they could arrange a vehicle for me to visit Dakhya Prajapati temple at Banapur. They were surprised at my interests extending beyond the feathered friends and said “Why do you want to go there doctor? There is just an old temple there!” Undeterred, I asked for a taxi and after a journey of one and a half hours we reached the small dusty town of Banapur.
When I got down from the car, I was surrounded by a group of boys who were playing cricket outside the temple. They were curious as to why I was visiting the place and kept following me as I went around the temple which was totally deserted.
Dakhya Prajapati temple is one of the relatively well preserved monuments of the Ganga period. It is dated to the Eastern Ganga dynasty which ruled in the early part of 13th century. It was during this period that temple architecture reached its pinnacle in Orissa. The temple is carved out of khondolite stone, which is named after the khond tribe, in whose terrain it is often sourced. Most of the temples in Orissa, including the Sun Temple at Konarak are built with this type of stone, which unfortunately is easily eroded by weather.
The temple tower is in the Nagara style and is intricately carved with many beautiful figures. These figures were interspersed with delicate scroll work. Among them was a small sculpture of Mahishasuramardini which was enclosed by a stunning border. Durga’s encounter with Mahisha has been a popular subject among artists for centuries. Most often she is depicted either serenely or victoriously, standing on the decapitated head of the buffalo or in the act of killing a buffalo headed figure from whose cut neck the demon emerges. The focus of the depiction here was not on the combat between the goddess and the demon, but on the goddess herself. She is seated here with wearing the karanda mukuta crown resembling a basket. Though her face was eroded, she seemed to be looking directly at the observer, offering her blessings. Mahishasura is usually represented in three forms: in his zoomorphic form he is shown as a buffalo, in the theriomorphic form he is supposed to have the body of a buffalo and the head of a man, and in the anthropomorphic form. Mahishasura can be seen at the bottom in the human form here. The iconography of Mahishasuramardini has never been a stagnant one and has undergone changes over time as the image was incorporated and depicted in different regions of India. As time progressed, the images also became more ornate.
After having a good look at the sculptures, I entered the sanctum and was warmly welcomed by a young man who spoke English. After offering the arathi to the main deity, he narrated the mythology associated with the temple. Dakhya is the son of Brahma and the father of Sati. Dakhya means “able” and Prajapati is the Lord of all creatures. Here he is worshipped in the form of Lord Siva as Dakhyeswar. Hence it is also referred to as Dakhyeswar Siva temple.
As I was leaving, I asked him as to how he spoke such good English! He told me that he worked as a laborer in Whitefield, but grew tired of the urban chaos and returned home. He said “I come here every day and offer puja to the deity…I don’t earn much but I find immense peace in serving him..it is a labor of love” I was deeply touched by his words.
In his own quiet way he was conveying that fulfillment through exalted work is the highest form of virtue in life.
Traveling in not just about discovering places. There is something undeniably magical in these small moments when you meet people who open up new vistas and enrich your understanding of life.
Aren’t we all stones
Dreaming of shapes
That we might become
Awaiting the chisel
Of the Creator?
25/10/20, 10:39 am - Nalini N R: We are so deeply steeped in the materialistic world not giving credence to the the small things which may not give money or name. Very moving but validates the thoughts. Thanks Sir for a holistic trip!

Over the last nine days, I had posted various sculptural depictions of Mahishasuramardini across India…each one of them distinctly different and impressive. On this tenth day of Vijayadashami let me take you down south to Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu.
When the Vijayanagara Empire fell, it splintered into several smaller kingdoms controlled by Nayakas, Telugu-speaking warriors from the Andhra region. The greatest period of temple construction in Tamil Nadu after the famed Chola temples of the 11th-13th centuries occurred during their rule.
The ancient temple at Thirukurungudi, situated an hour’s drive from Tirunelveli is one such gem. As per the Vaishnava tradition, Thirukkurungudi is one among the 108 Vaishnava shrines and is said to be the ‘Southern Home’ of Lord Vishnu and is hence called ‘Dakshina Badri’.
The main deity is Azhagiya Nambi Rayar also referred to as “Sundara Paripoornam”, meaning “Perfect and complete beauty”. True to its name, it is one of the most beautiful portrayals of Vishnu. Not just the main deity, the entire temple complex is replete with some stunningly gorgeous sculptures.
The Chitra Gopuram of the temple is one of the most beautiful structures I have ever seen. Every inch of its façade is richly carved with panels depicting scenes from various epics. Each one of them demonstrates the sculptors' careful attention to detail and depict many mythological themes which are found nowhere else.
The most attractive section in the Chitra Gopuram depicts the slaying of the demon Mahishasura. In one of the smallest of panels in the tower, the talented sculptor has carved the scene in intricate detail. Devi is seen with eighteen hands, each one of them holding a different weapon and objects. Even the folds of her dress have been engraved with much care; every fold and every crease is visible. Her right leg is firmly in position on Mahisha’s neck, while piercing him with a sharp trident. As the Asura warriors watch the scene, the lion is also sinking its teeth into the demon. The victorious smile on her face is unmistakable!
As her arrow
Rests in the quiver
Let us recall these lines . . .
इत्थं यदा यदा बाधा दानवोत्था भविष्यति ।
तदा तदाऽवतीर्याहं करिष्याम्यरिसंक्षयम् ।।
“Whenever trouble arises due to the advent of the demons, I shall incarnate and destroy the foes. “
(Markandeypurana, 91.51: Eleventh Chapter of the Devi Mahatmya)
26/10/20, 1:53 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. Fantastic Sir. Though we can't compare with other sculptures, this appears to be very appealing, energetic and there is a contagious feeling of triumph🙏 Hope some day I will be able to go that temple!

27/10/20, 7:17 am - Dr Raguram: Cherish and value all your resposes and comments over the past ten days
27/10/20, 9:22 am - Nalini N R: Sir I have to thank you for taking on a tour which was worth being a part of. Yes they have to connect deep within us. Otherwise it will be a futile picnic for fun.
28/10/20, 12:42 pm - Nalini N R: Probably the only idol in the world that was made using three metals: silver, copper and brass.🙏🏼 Here the face of the Goddess is made of silver, the rest of the body is made of copper and the cloth is made of brass. The melting points of these three metals are different. There is no welding anywhere on this idol, it is an unbroken idol. The same feature is of the lion below the goddess, the whole body is of copper and the ayal is of brass. Even today, attempts to make such idols have failed.

14/01/21, 7:57 am - Dr Raguram: Pongal (like other harvest festivals in India), is a day to worship and express gratitude to the Sun God for helping the crops to flourish by providing energy for their growth. It marks the beginning of Uttarayan, the sun’s transition northwards for a six-month period. 
There are numerous depictions of Hari-Hara (a combined form of Shiva and Vishnu) but it is relatively rare to see a combined form of Surya and Shiva. One such unusual depiction is at Khajuraho. On the right half of this sculpture is Surya, the Sun God. He is holding lotuses: a fully bloomed one in one hand and a bud in the other. The left half is Shiva and he is holding a snake and a water pot.
एक एव हि लोकानाम् सूर्य आत्मादिकृद् हरिः।
The Sun God, a manifestation of Lord Hari, resides in the Soul of everyone in this world
Bhagavata Purana, 12.11.30:
அருக்கன் பாதம் வணங்குவர் அந்தியில் 
அருக்கனாவான் அரனுரு அல்லனோ

20/04/21, 11:47 am - Dr Raguram: n the vast, arid landscape of the Great Rann of Kutch, saw this woman walking alone, holding her baby close to her. The sun was bearing down relentlessly and the heat was quite oppressive. None of which seemed to dissuade her to reach where she wanted to…with grit and determination.
She leads the way for us in the midst of the gloom and despair that envelops us now…

01/05/21, 11:49 am - Dr Raguram: On this Labor Day, let us focus attention on the Worker Bee!
They are born sterile and their sole purpose is to continue to work during their entire lifespan. 
Worker bees are essentially the lifeblood of the hive. Without worker bees, there would be no one to care for the ever important queen, produce honey or pollinate plants and flowers. 
The job for the worker bee changes through their life-span. 
Younger ones handle cell cleaning and foraging outside is for the older bees. When the older ones return to the hive they leave packets on nectar for the house bound worker bees who then deposit them in the marked cells. 
Worker bees live for about five weeks and then die.
They literally work themselves to death to help the survival of the hive…
01/05/21, 1:00 pm - Nalini N R: Nature is the best tutor! But who has the time to even glance at it? Today's generation retires very early in life and we talk about life style! Thank you Sir for dragging our attention to beehive, selfless service on May day.

12/05/21, 10:50 am - Dr Raguram: Once in the city of Vesali there was widespread famine and spreading disease. There were many dead bodies as the conditions overwhelmed the ability to properly dispose of bodies. The local citizens sought out the Buddha’s help, who was nearby in Rajagaha. The Buddha arrived in Vesali a short time later with a large number of monks, including Ananda. Just before the Buddha’s arrival, torrential rains helped the situation somewhat by cleansing the landscape of rotting corpses and clearing the air and water.
Prior to his presenting this discourse, he instructed his attending monks to walk through the city and do what they could to ease the physical suffering of the citizens and to individually present this teaching. At the formal teaching the Buddha then presented a way to bring true refuge from the stress and suffering of the world and to  put an end to all dukkha... https://youtu.be/Dte6qZarSks
12/05/21, 12:16 pm - Nalini N R: It was very nice Sir. Soothing and giving strength. Praying for all the beings, being compassionate which is glaringly missing during this pandemic. Vishwatma buddhi.

13/05/21, 8:45 am - Dr Raguram: There are moments of reprieve in these gloomy times.
The sky is getting darker and a billowy wind is blowing across. As the raindrops start caressing the leaves, the chirping birds search for shelter. An interesting medley sounds softly floats in the air. 
I keep wondering whether the bird calls are sounding different in these times. There seems to be a discernibly upbeat quality in their songs. Or perhaps given the lack of noise due to the lockdown their calls are heard more vividly. 
The soundscape replete with mellifluous calls of birds soothens the angst of isolation. 
There is an intricate, ineffable relationship between the landscape outside of us and that within. 
In the words of Rumi, “Birdsongs brings relief to my longing” and I retreat into the silence within…
13/05/21, 12:21 pm - Nalini N R: Yes. Very true Sir. Yesterday I was having a session with my patient in Delhi who is in home but Guesthouse isolation, due to COVID,  next to Lodhi Gardens. As her father is down with stroke post COVID at home. I had to literally compete with so many birds including parrots who were making merry, shrill sounds, songs at times I felt screams, trying to get back to their nests, in the dusk. But I enjoyed though it was to a certain extent distraction!

17/05/21, 7:47 am - Dr Raguram: In all his works Adi Shankara laid emphasis on a formless divine (nirguna brahman) being the only reality, outside all binaries.
On this Shankara Jayanthi, I was reminded of these lines from his Pratah Smarana Stotram, the Morning Prayer.
प्रातर्भजामि मनसा वचसामगम्यं
वाचो विभान्ति निखिला यदनुग्रहेण ।
Pratarbhajámi manasá vacasámagamyam
vacho vibhánti nikhilá yadanugrahena.
The prayer at dawn is profoundly significant in that the dawn is the outer symbol of the inner awakening. 
(The English translation of the verse is in the photograph!)
17/05/21, 12:25 pm - Nalini N R: Blessed we are to have such great Acharyas who help us to seek knowledge and experience the divinity. One of the most productive aftermath of COVID is the chance to dwell upon impermanence and develop the interest to go beyond! Thank you Sir for the inspiration to begin a day🙏🏻

25/05/21, 2:13 pm - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
25/05/21, 2:13 pm - Dr Raguram: Today is Narasimha Jayanti.
Narasimha is one of the ten incarnations of Vishnu. He has often been depicted in nine different forms, Nava Narasimha which can be seen in the temple at Ahobilam.
Sculptors from the Hoysala period depicted some of these forms in intricate detail. This one from Halebeedu depicts him seated with the demon Hiranyakashipu in his lap. He is portrayed with six arms; two upper hands hold the shanku and chakra, the bottom two hands are grasping the demon in a tight grip while the two arms in the middle are tearing his entrails apart. Even the intestines have been depicted in detail! Prahlada can be seen in the bottom left offering obeisance. 
As Ananda Coomaraswamy commented, sculptures in Indian temples are not patterned after any ‘living model.’ They represent an unending array of imagery, steeped in symbolism. What could be the symbolism behind the sculpture?
To me he is an iconic symbol of intensive resistance to unjust things, hope against odds, triumph of the good over persecution and evil. He is the annihilator of maleficent forces within and outside of us.
25/05/21, 3:12 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. We continue to be on the basic step of doing rituals. If the Sagunopasana can be done keeping in mind what you have explained, helps us to go to the higher level of understanding the Nirguna Brahma.
25/05/21, 10:39 pm - Nalini N R: Fantastic sculpture. Your description forces us to scan the picture carefully!

26/05/21, 7:46 am - Dr Raguram: On the occasion of Buddha Jayanthi today, I was recollecting my sojourn to the Mahabodhi temple.
It had rained the previous evening and the cool breeze of the morning kept me company as I slowly made my way to the temple. Since I was keen to reach the place early, there was hardly anyone at that time. A group of Buddhist monks were walking and chanting melodiously at a distance. I went around the temple and sat in front of the Bodhi tree. Early morning sun was peeping through its leaves.
For more than a month, Siddhartha (as Buddha was earlier called) meditated beneath it and attained enlightenment. It is said that emperor Ashoka's daughter, Sanghamitta took a branch from the original Bodhi tree to Sri Lanka and planted it in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. That Bodhi tree is still alive there and is supposedly one of the oldest continually documented trees in the world. The tree I was sitting in front has been grown from a sapling brought from the one in Sri Lanka.
Forest and trees are intimately associated with Buddha. He was reportedly born under the ashoka tree(though some say it was a mango tree), attained enlightenment under the papal tree and entered into mahaparinirvana under the sala tree. Further, four trees are associated with the enlightenment of the Buddha. He sat under a pipal tree for the first seven days, in the bliss of his enlightenment; then he arose and sat under a nyagrodha, the banyan tree for another seven days, in the bliss of his illumination; then he sat beneath a muchalinda (Indian oak) for another seven days, in the bliss of his calm; and, finally, he sat beneath a rajayatana (wild mango) for seven days, in the bliss of his emancipation. The four trees are known as the Tree of Enlightenment, the Tree of the Goatherd, the Tree of Muchalinda, and the Tree of Emancipation, respectively.
There has been a strong association with spirituality and sacred trees in Indian history and I was sitting under one of them to savor a fleeting glimpse of the infinite.
With the chants echoing in the distance, I slowly immersed myself in the experience of feeling His presence. As I lost myself amidst the canopy in front of me, I felt that He was whispering in my ears, “Any tree could be your Bodhi tree…”
26/05/21, 12:02 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. It is so enchanting. Thank you so much Sir,  for the enlightening information about the trees associated with Gautham Buddha's enlightenment. If one can virtually experience what you have described I wonder about and little envy (!) the actual experience you must have savoured.

29/06/21, 8:58 am - Dr Raguram: Today is the Camera Day!
Each of us would like to freeze a fleeting, wonderful moment…that stays…
Camera for me, in the words of Henri Cartier-Bresson is “a sketch book, an instrument of intuition and spontaneity.”
29/06/21, 12:24 pm - Nalini N R: And the caption you give magnifies your perspective Sir 👍

18/07/21, 10:51 am - Dr Raguram: A few years ago we visited Omi International Arts Center in Ghent, off the beaten path in the gorgeous Hudson Valley countryside. It is a vast open space of over 100 acres studded with nearly 80 sculptures which blend into the landscape. We spent several hours exploring the magical space and savoring large-scale works of contemporary and modern artists. As I made my way amidst the rolling farmland and undulating meadows, I felt that I was in “Constable Country!”
 John Constable was largely responsible for reviving the landscape painting in 19th century. He began painting canvases in the open air, with striking results. Using finely executed brushwork, he synthesized elements of light and shade to convey the radiance of the Suffolk countryside. 
I was not carrying my camera and this image of the radiant landscape of the OMI Center was taken with the iPhone.
18/07/21, 4:51 pm - Nalini N R: Sir, simply beautiful. Takes us to a different world altogether. Fingers itch to paint. I used to try oil colours and that's history.
18/07/21, 4:58 pm - Dr Raguram: Do recreate history Nalini😊
18/07/21, 7:49 pm - Nalini N R: Not so great Sir. Copy cat 🙄
18/07/21, 7:50 pm - Dr Raguram: Would like to have a look sometime!
18/07/21, 7:51 pm - Nalini N R: Ok Will send the image.
18/07/21, 7:52 pm - Dr Raguram: 👍

20/07/21, 8:01 pm - Dr Raguram: Whenever I see this small statuette on my desk I am reminded of Francis of Assisi, who abandoned a life of luxury and embraced the vow of poverty.
He had a deep love of nature and animals and is known as the patron saint of ecology.
These lines from Prayer of St Francis are extraordinarily evocative:
O divine Master
grant that I may not so much seek
to be consoled as to console,
to be understood as to understand,
to be loved as to love.
For it is in giving that we receive…
20/07/21, 10:22 pm - Nalini N R: Ohh. What an extraordinary statuette chisled so well and hats off to you Sir who can associate with the higher order thought. Yes like Purandara Dasa who was a miser but gave up everything to seek God. Very aptly written. Striving towards it matters, though they are baby steps.
22/07/21, 12:17 pm - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
22/07/21, 12:17 pm - Dr Raguram: The Jataka tales are an important part of Buddhist art and literature. They describe the previous births of the Buddha in both human and non-human forms. The tales were often delicately sculpted in stupas. One such depiction of the Mahakapi Jataka appears on the western gateway of the Great Stupa at Sanchi.
The king is shown with a parasol over his head travelling with an entourage. To the right of the king an archer appears with bow and arrow aiming at the monkeys.  Realizing that their lives are in peril, they appeal to the Great Monkey (Bodhisattva) who climbs onto the mango tree, grabbing the branch firmly, stretching himself across the river. The relief show the Bodhisattva as the bridge by which monkeys escape to join the rest of the troop in the forest. Notice the depiction of the river with crocodile and fishes!
In the tale, when the king asked the Great Monkey as to why he risked his life to protect the monkeys he replies, "Great king, I guard the herd. I am their lord and chief. When they were filled with fear of your archers, I leapt a great distance to save them. I managed to hold the branch of the mango tree so that my monkeys could pass over my back and reach safety. Because I could save them, I have no fear of death. Like a righteous king, I could guarantee the happiness of those over whom I reign. Sir, understand this truth! If you wish to be a righteous ruler, the happiness of your kingdom, your cities, and your people must be dear to you. It must be dearer than your life."
A timely reminder these days, especially on this World Mango Day!!
22/07/21, 3:14 pm - Nalini N R: It looks like an embedded figures test. So beautifully depicted whatever had to be conveyed 👍
24/07/21, 8:21 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
24/07/21, 8:21 am - Dr Raguram: The thirst for knowledge is an eternal quest which requires the help of a Guru. On this Guru Purnima day let us pay obeisance to Shri Dakshinamurthy, the Adi Guru. He is the personification of spiritual wisdom and knowledge. His teaching is through the subtlest form of speech called para vak, which can be felt in the vibrations of silence. 
There are many depictions of Dakshinamurthy in sculptural form. The most beautiful of them is in Kailasanathar Kovil in Kancheepuram. Here you can see him seatped under a tree, giving a sermon. So much so, even the snake that adorns his neck has crawled down to sit and listen to him! There are two antelopes below him. They are a metaphor for a quick thinking human mind. His stance is also quite unusual. With his left foot crossed over his right knee he is gracefully turning towards us. The immaculate attention to the finer aspects is visible in the sole of the left foot, with the arches and instep sculpted in exquisite detail. On top on either side are the Kanakadi Rishis; Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana and Sanat Kumara. They are the four sons of Brahma who are considered as the greatest of gyanis. Though old in years due to their exemplary spiritual attainments, they maintained themselves eternally as small children. 
ॐ नमः प्रणवार्थाय शुद्धज्ञानैकमूर्तये ।
निर्मलाय प्रशान्ताय दक्षिणामूर्तये नमः ॥५॥
Salutations to the embodiment of Pranava (Om)
Salutations to the personification of the Pure, Non-Dual Knowledge,
Salutations to the Pure and Tranquil Sri Dakshinamurthy.
24/07/21, 4:30 pm - Nalini N R: <Media omitted>
24/07/21, 4:37 pm - Nalini N R: Thank you very much Sir for the enlightening narration. Today is the sixth anniversary of my son Adithya's release from the mortal remains.   Very important to dwell on the spiritual knowledge than getting entangled in the transactional world. Salutations to Guru who kindles it.

29/07/21, 10:28 am - Dr Raguram: Nature has always been a source of inspiration for poets.
Mahakavi Bharathiyar wrote a series of Vachana Kavithai (Prose Poems) titled Kaatchi (Vision). It is a work of immense literary and spiritual significance. In its style and imagination, they are unique in the history of Tamil literature. Some of these verses are akin to verses from the Rig Vediv hymns which laid emphasis on the worship of nature in its most sublime aspects.
It is believed that Mahakavi Bharathiyar studied the Rig Veda under the tutelage of Sri Aurobindo.
This particular verse about the setting sun is redolent with sublime imagery…. 
ஞாயிறே,இருளை என்ன செய்துவிட்டாய்? 
ஓட்டினாயா? கொன்றாயா? விழுங்கிவிட்டாயா? 
கட்டி முத்தமிட்டு நின் கதிர்களாகிய கைகளால் மறைத்துவிட்டாயா?
இருள் நினக்குப் பகையா?
இருள் நின் உணவுப் பொருளா?
அது நின் காதலியா?
இரவெல்லாம் நின்னைக் காணாத மயக்கத்தால் இருண்டிருந்ததா?
நின்னைக் கண்டவுடன் நின்னொளி தானுங்கொண்டு நின்னைக் கலந்துவிட்டதா?
நீங்கள் இருவரும் ஒருதாய் வயிற்றுக் குழந்தைகளா? 
முன்னும் பின்னுமாக வந்து
உலகத்தைக் காக்கும்படி உங்கள் தாய் ஏவி யிருக்கிறாளா? 
உங்களுக்கு மரண மில்லையா? 
நீங்கள் அமுதமா? 
உங்களைப் புகழ்கின்றேன்.

These verses resonate deeply whenever I watch a gorgeous sunset….
(Would welcome an English translation of this verse…tried in vain to capture its beauty…)
29/07/21, 1:46 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. What a sight Sir. The sky itself looks velwetty and comforting! I didn't learn to read Tamil though my mother and sister could. Will tell my sister to read for me!
29/07/21, 1:55 pm - Dr Raguram: 👍

01/08/21, 10:37 am - Dr Raguram: A most beautiful discovery is to find a friend in need. 
Guhan appears at a pivotal moment in Rama’s exile when he reached the banks of the Ganga along with Sita and Lakshmana. He had to cross the waters to go across to the dense forest. It is at this point that Guhan, who was the chieftain of the forest tribe, appears and offers to take them across. A strong bond develops between the two, with Rama calling Guhan his ‘friend’. Rama also adopts him as his fifth brother. 
முன்புஉளெம் ஒருநால்வேம் முடிவுளது எனஉன்னா
அன்புஉள இனிநாம்ஓர் ஐவர்கள் உளர்ஆனோம்
(Verse from Kamba Ramayanam)
This mural is from Bodinayakanur Zamin Palace
01/08/21, 3:12 pm - Nalini N R: Sir, what an association with Rama and Guhan painted so beautifully on friendship day. Guhan reciprocated wonderfully Rama's magnanimous terming of relationship with him. He so deeply loved Rama and wanted to protect him as he suspected his brothers Lakshmana and Bharata if they plotted to kill him!
08/08/21, 10:07 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
08/08/21, 1:03 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir, which is very unique. The caption coincided with the smell I was getting from watering a plant which I hadn't 🙄 The droplets of rain are also visible in the photograph!

12/08/21, 11:10 am - Dr Raguram: World Elephant Day, observed every year on August 12, draws attention to their importance in our ecosystem and emphasizes the need for their conservation and protection. 
At one time in history elephants played a crucial part in warfare. They had a huge psychological impact in wars because their majestic sight and destructive potential. Their sheer size and ability to get rid of a number of enemy foot soldiers at one sweep created panic in the battlefield. Monarchs from different ruling dynasties like Magadha, Maurya, Gupta, and Chola enlisted these doe-eyed gigantic creatures in the army and they continued to be used by Indian warriors, right unto the seventeenth century. 
Thankfully, the use of war elephants gradually declined at the end of medieval era after the advent of gunpowder. 
This depiction of the war elephant is from a 16th century Nayak era mural at Thiruppudaimaruthur temple
12/08/21, 5:25 pm - Nalini N R: I didn't know there was something like world elephant day. Thank you Sir for the information. Man has learnt to be destructive driven by selfish motives. No wonder nature is paying back in the same coin!

I was reminded of my first encounter a few years ago with the Southern Flyind Lizard.

Feel free to post your comments in the blog:-)
14/08/21, 4:28 pm - Nalini N R: Oh I tend to have very negative emotions when it comes to cockroach and lizard! And today is the world lizard day! I think it is only humans who tend to dislike other creatures for no reason. Will go through Sir. Hope it doesn't magnify my feelings.
15/08/21, 9:37 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
15/08/21, 9:37 am - Dr Raguram: Today is also the birthday of Sri Aurobindo and on the threshold of 75 years of independence, let us recall some of his words…
“Our actual enemy is not any force exterior to ourselves, but our own crying weaknesses, our cowardice, our selfishness, our hypocrisy, our purblind sentimentalism…. True freedom has to be discovered within the human heart, has to flower into the acceptance of ‘the other' as brother or sister, not just in theory…”
15/08/21, 12:21 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. That is true independence. Self realisation and the knowledge of oneness. Wonderful Sir. And what a photograph 👍Caught at the right moment!

16/08/21, 12:21 pm - Dr Raguram: It is difficult to convey the grim reality on the ground in Afghanistan, especially its impact on the women.
Some years ago, on an early morning in the sand dunes of Khuri, I saw this woman trudging alone the vast landscape, delicately balancing a pot on her head.
I was wondering where she was heading to, treading on this harsh terrain, as the nearest human habitat was several miles ahead.
Will memories of her home guide her or will it always be away?
16/08/21, 1:07 pm - Nalini N R: The moment I read the caption, it reminded of me of Afghanistan. Very sad. It is not going to auger well even at the international level. It is so picturesque. But for people like her?
19/08/21, 8:40 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
19/08/21, 8:40 am - Dr Raguram: The movement of light and shadows formed by the interplay of trees, wind and sunlight on the landscape is always quite entrancing.
The Japanese have a unique word for this occurrence: komorebi, which is made up of the kanji characters for tree, shine through and sun.
It is quite an untranslatable, poetic word. The closest in English might be dappled sunlight!
More than a word, it is an awe-filled feeling…
A glimpse of that ephemeral moment on this World Photography Day…
19/08/21, 1:06 pm - Nalini N R: What a sight Sir! Away from the maddening crowd just to be in the cradle of nature. Fantastic photograph with sunlight, trees and its reflection in water, above all that, your thought expressed in language!
19/08/21, 1:23 pm - Dr Raguram: Thanks!

20/08/21, 9:56 am - Dr Raguram: Doorways are much more than mere entrances into homes. 
They are gateways into life. They open up our worlds, yet protecting us from outside. 
Traditional homes in Tamil Nadu have elaborately carved doorways with intricate detailing.
In this small panel in an old house, Goddess Lakshmi is seated on a lotus flanked by two richly carved elephants holding pitchers of water, offering abhisheka . In her upper two hands she is holding lotuses. Having roots in the mud, yet blooming above, they represent spiritual quest and strivings. The lower right hand is in abhayamudra with her palm open, symbolizing reassurance and protection while the lower left hand is in varadamudra, palm facing down bestowing boons.
Varalakshmi Vrata is performed today by women in many southern Indian states for the wellbeing of the family and it is believed that observing it is equivalent to worshipping Ashtalakshmis. 
पद्मसने पद्मकरे सर्व लोकैक पूजिते। 
नारायणप्रिये देवि सुप्रीता भव सर्वदा॥
She who sits in the lotus, holding the lotus,
To whom all worlds pray
Goddess dear to Sri Narayana
I offer my humble prayers to thee…

21/08/21, 9:50 am - Dr Raguram: Onam is all about colours, love, and of course good food. 
Like all festivals there is an interesting legend behind it! 
The story is woven around the popular myth of the truthful and benevolent King Mahabali, affectionately called Maveli.  He was the grandson of Prahlada and an ardent worshipper of Lord Vishnu. Under his reign, people led a happy and harmonious life. Mahabali’s fame as a judicious ruler began to spread far and wide which made the Devas jealous and they requested Vishnu to curb Mahabali’s powers. 
Vishnu in his incarnation as a dwarf brahmin called Vamana, approached the generous king while he was performing a yagna and asked for alms. Being kind and charitable, Mahabali granted him a wish in spite of his preceptor Sukracharya’s caution. Vamana just asked for three paces of land and the king agreed to it. Lord Vishnu grew in size as Trivikrama and scaled the entire universe in two steps. To keep his word, the noble king offered his head for him to place his third step. 
There is a beautiful panel in the Varaha cave built in the 7th century by King Mahendravarman I, at Mahabalipuram which depicts this story. 
The relief potrays Trivikrama with eight hands which carries 'shanka'(counch), 'gada' (club), 'chakra' (wheel), 'dhanush' (bow), 'khetaka'(shield) and 'khadga' (sword). There are figures around him in three levels. At ground level are four men, two on either side, seated to indicate the earth. At the second level are the sun & moon identified by the halo around their head, indicating the sky. In the third level above there is Brahma on the right and Siva on the left representing the Swargalokha. Beside Brahma is Jambavan who is beating a drum in jubilation. Beneath Trivikrama’s raised leg on his third stride is Mahabali falling down to earth in a sprawling posture. 
Moved by this gesture of King Mahabali, Vishnu grants him permission to visit his kingdom once a year. 
Thiruvonam is considered to be the day when King Mahabali comes from exile to visit his beloved people. 
Wishing everyone a very happy and prosperous Onam! 
ഓണാശംസകൾ!
21/08/21, 1:17 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. We celebrate Balipadyami on the third day of Diwali when Balichakravarthi  (who is pushed down to patala loka as he didn't obey his Guru) is permitted to come to earth and we do the puja to the threshold of the front door. The days when it is celebrated are different but story is the same! Thank you and wish you all the same🙏🏻

22/08/21, 10:28 am - Dr Raguram: Raksha Bandan is made up of two words, "Raksha" and "Bandhan" where "Raksha" stands for protection and "Bandhan" signifies the verb to tie. It symbolizes the eternal brother-sister bond which is not confined to just blood relationships.
Like many Hindu festivals, Raksha Bandan has several mythological origins.
Once Lord Krishna injured his wrist when while using his sudarshana chakra against the king Shishupalal. Seeing his hand bleeding, Draupadi who was nearby tore a piece from her sari and tied it around his hand to stem the flow of blood. Lord Krishna was moved by this kind gesture and considered the piece of saree as a sacred thread. He vowed that he would always be there to protect her. He said “Akshyam”, meaning “unending”. This is how her saree became endless when she was disrobed in public by Dushasana.  By protecting her from humiliation Lord Krishna affirmed his enduring bond with Draupadi.  
This panel which is just a few inches in dimension is from Amruteshwara temple at Amrutapura in Karnataka depicts Draupadi vastrabharanam.
It is interesting too to note that Rabindranath Tagore started a mass Raksha Bandhan festival during the Partition of Bengal, encouraging Hindu and Muslim women to tie a rakhi on men from the other community to consider them as their brothers.
22/08/21, 1:39 pm - Nalini N R: Beautiful sculpture Sir and once again thanks for the enlightening narration 🙏🏻

28/08/21, 10:42 am - Dr Raguram: Nandi halt is a quaint and beautiful railways station at the foothills of Nandi hill. A beautiful but derelict building sits in the midst of vast green fields. Many old trees dominate the area adding serenity and beauty to the place. I couldn’t take my eyes of this majestic one!
Forever young
Your tangled branches
Sway in breeze
Whispering timeless secrets…
28/08/21, 1:24 pm - Nalini N R: Looking at the photograph itself gives the experience of cool, soothing shadows. What to say about the actual experience of looking at and sitting under the tree! Something which is inconspicuous to most catches your eye and translates it into words Sir!

02/09/21, 8:55 am - Dr Raguram: Hampi has an enduring presence in spite of ravages of wars and time.
The melancholic beauty of the ruins has an irresistible charm.
Amidst the vast landscape, giant boulders of various sizes and hues reach out to the sky. These were once part of gigantic granite monoliths of the Dharwar Craton which date back to 2.5 billion years.
Nature has sculpted these rocks in amazing shapes, many of them balancing precariously on the craggy hills.
02/09/21, 9:22 am - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. They appear to be silent, stable spectators, their presence not affected by ups and downs around!
04/09/21, 11:09 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
04/09/21, 11:09 am - Dr Raguram: Today is the International Vulture Awareness Day to draw attention to the importance of preservation of this often reviled bird for the yeomen service they do in keeping the ecosystem in balance.  My dear friend Bharathidasan has been doing exemplary work in their conservation through his organization Arulagam. 
Often seen alone, this majestic Red Headed Vulture is a timid bird in spite of its size. It usually refrains from fighting with other birds at a carcass. Instead, it waits patiently before hurriedly making a foray and withdrawing with a bite of flesh.
04/09/21, 12:37 pm - Nalini N R: As humans with a developed brain, we should learn from it. Such a beautiful photograph Sir!

07/09/21, 8:48 am - Dr Raguram: Anagalis Moneli orBlue Pimpernel has one of the brightest blue petals in nature and is named after French horticulturist Jean Monelle.
It is also called ‘poor man’s barometer’ as the blue blossoms remain closed in dusky, cold weather and open when the sun comes up.
It is quite a charmer with its pink eye and yellow anthers in the midst of silky blue petals!
07/09/21, 10:28 pm - Nalini N R: Beautiful blue flower, Sir. The photograph has made the colour striking, because of hazy green background.

10/09/21, 7:48 am - Dr Raguram: Ganesha, as we know him today, appears as a distinct deity during the Gupta period. With the advent of the Puranic tradition, he emerged as a major God with a sect of his own called Ganapatyas. By the seventh century CE, Adi Shankara included the worship of Ganapati as one of the six systems (shanmata) of the Hindu religion.
There are 32 forms of Ganesha and he continues to be depicted in various pleomorphic forms inspired by the creative spirits of the artists!
One of the magnificent images of Ganesha is in Hampi, often referred to as Sasivekalu Ganesha. This monolithic statue is carved out of a single block of granite rock and is housed in an open pavilion.
Ganesha holds an axe in the upper right hand and a noose in the upper left hand. He holds the axe urging the devotee to destroy unwanted, evil thoughts that can lead one into Adharma. The noose or pasha in Ganesha's left hand is an implement to capture all difficulties. The noose conveys that worldly attachments are a noose around man’s neck. In order to attain spiritual perfection, one should cut the worldly attachments and attain spiritual enlightenment. In his lower left hand he is holding his favourite sweet the  
 “modak”. ‘Mod (मोद)’ means Anand and ‘ka (क)’ means a small portion. Therefore, modak is a small portion of Anand. He is holding a broken tusk in the right lower hand which he used as a writing tool for the Mahabharata epic.
A snake is tied around his prominent belly (which incidentally resembles a mustard seed and hence the name!). The popular tale is that once Ganesha ate lots of food and his stomach was almost bursting. In order to hold it back, he tied a snake around it!
However, the surprise element in this sculpture is at the back when one notices Devi Parvathi holding Ganesha in her lap! This is a very unusual and unique depiction of Ganesha!
As with other Hindu Gods the story of Ganesha is embedded in varying mythological narratives which are replete with multiple symbolic interpretations. It also interweaves with folk elements reflecting a community’s understanding and interpretation of the God in relation to their lifeworld’s.

18/09/21, 9:12 am - Dr Raguram: Wisława Szymborska the Nobel laureate from Poland is often referred to as the ‘Mozart of Poetry’. In her works which are deceptively simple, she draws attention to the extraordinary in the ordinary like this observation about a tree sprouting amidst rocks.
The little tree that springs up
In some inexplicable fashion
On the side of a cliff
Where are its roots, what does it feed on
What miracle produces those green leaves?
18/09/21, 3:17 pm - Nalini N R: No wonder she is referred to like that. Few lines trigger thoughts. A free flow of thoughts in words without much ado!

21/09/21, 8:52 am - Dr Raguram: Sip your Tea, Nice and Slow

No one ever knows
when it’s Time to Go,
There’ll be no Time
to enjoy the Glow,
So sip your Tea
Nice and Slow.

Life is too Short but
feels pretty Long,
There’s too much to do, so much going Wrong,
And Most of the Time You Struggle to be Strong,
Before it’s too Late
and it’s time to Go,
Sip your Tea
Nice and Slow.

Some Friends stay,
others Go away,
Loved ones are Cherished but not all will Stay.
Kids will Grow up
and Fly away.
There’s really no Saying how Things will Go,
So sip your Tea
Nice and Slow.

In the end, it’s really
all about understanding Love
For this World
and in the Stars above,
Appreciate and Value who truly Cares,
Smile and Breathe
and let your Worries go,
So Just Sip your Tea
Nice and Slow.

This poem is beyond all relationships
But made for us all.

When I’m dead.
Your tears will flow
But I won’t know
Cry with me now instead.

You will send flowers,
But I won’t see
Send them now instead

You’ll say words of praise
But I won’t hear.
Praise me now instead

You’ll forget my faults,
But I won’t know…..
Forget them now instead.

You’ll miss me then,
But I won’t feel.
Miss me now, instead.

You’ll wish You could have spent more time with me,
Spend it now instead

When you hear I’m gone, you’ll find your way to my house to pay condolence but we haven’t even spoken in years.
Look for me now-
21/09/21, 8:52 am - Dr Raguram: Written by the Singaporean poet Anne Lee Tzu Pheng, this remarkable poem dwells on the nature of time and the relationship humans share. It invites the reader to be present in the moment rather than losing oneself in regret and guilt about the incontrovertible nature of time and lost opportunities. This poem is to remind us to take our time to live life and appreciate the value of life and memories that lives on beyond time and death.
21/09/21, 5:35 pm - Dr Raguram: Today is Alzheimer's Day
The most poignant aspect of dementia is whether it is more painful to forget, or to be forgotten...
A very perceptive reflection on forgetfulness is a poem by my  favorite poet, Billy Collins.
FORGETFULNESS
The name of the author is the first to go
Followed obediently by the title, the plot,
The heartbreaking conclusion, the entire novel
Which suddenly becomes one you have never read,
Never even heard of,
As if, one by one, the memories you used to harbor
Decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain,
To a little fishing village where there are no phones.
Long ago you kissed the names of the nine Muses goodbye
And watched the quadratic equation pack its bag,
And even now as you memorize the order of the planets,
Something else is slipping away, a state flower perhaps,
The address of an uncle, the capital of Paraguay.
Whatever it is you are struggling to remember
It is not poised on the tip of your tongue,
Not even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen.
It has floated away down a dark mythological river
Whose name begins with an L as far as you can recall,
Well on your own way to oblivion where you will join those
Who have even forgotten how to swim and how to ride a bicycle.
No wonder you rise in the middle of the night
To look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war.
No wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted
Out of a love poem that you used to know by heart.
21/09/21, 6:49 pm - Nalini N R: Wow. What bitter truth. The chaotic rat race with no goal post visible. Amidst this the pains of forgetfulness and pressure by the caretakers! True Sir. Being mindful and appreciating what is around is THE best technique.

22/09/21, 12:25 pm - Dr Raguram: The greater one-horned rhino is the largest of the rhino species. Its greyish brown hide with skin folds gives it an armour plated appearance. It can deposit as much as 25 kg of dung in a single defecation. The dung piles contain seeds which have been ingested by the rhino which germinate in the nutrient-rich dung. During the day, rhinos spend a lot of time in water or wallowing in mud in order to keep cool.  They are known to make about 10 sounds, including snorts, honks and roars! 
On the World Rhino Day let us recollect this verse from the Khaggavisana Sutta, a Buddhist Pali text…
Without resistance in all four directions,
content with whatever you get,
enduring troubles with no dismay,
wander alone
like a rhinoceros.
22/09/21, 10:34 pm - Nalini N R: Man with an evolved brain appears to have become very delicate despite having ability to think, reason. Too busy in complicating his life for nothing.

26/09/21, 10:28 am - Dr Raguram: Today is the birthday of the poet TS Eliot, someone whom I like immensely. He concludes his magnum opus, Waste Land with these lines of hope;
Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.
Shantih Shantih Shantih.
Interestingly, Datta, Dayadhvam and Damyata have their origin in the fifth chapter of the Brihdaranyaka Upanishad. Prajapati, the creator is asked by devas, men and demons for advice. Then the thunder said Da.. Da.. Da… Prajapathi asked them whether they understood the message. All the three groups nodded their heads saying ‘Yes, Master, we understood it very well’. Devas understood Da as Damyata, self-control. Da meant Datta, give, donate for humans. While for the demons Da meant Dayatva, compassion. 
Kanchi Paramacharya highlighted the importance of these three in his song Maithreem Bhajatha, made popular by MS Subbalakshmi
An English translation of this song I found on the web reads:
Serve with friendship and humility
Which will conquer the hearts of everyone.
Look upon others similar to yourself.
Renounce war
Renounce unnecessary competition for power
Give up aggression on others’ properties 
Mother Earth is broad enough to give us all we desire 
God is compassionate to all
Daamyata – So, Restrain yourself
Datta – So, Donate your wealth to others
Dayathvam – So, Be Kind to others
May all people of this world be happy and prosperous.
May all people of this world be happy and prosperous. 
May all people of this world be happy and prosperous.
26/09/21, 3:33 pm - Nalini N R: Fantastic Sir. Yes I had read this and I am ardent fan of Dr. MS and I love to hear that song. A good day to remember and inculcate what all of them have said.

29/09/21, 7:50 am - Dr Raguram: Early in the morning, in the jungle, our attention was drawn to an extraordinarily wide range of loud calls – whistles, wails, screeches, and gurgles. Soon enough, we spotted the origin of these sounds; a flock of noisy birds with striking orange beaks and yellow markings in it neck and nape. Their glossy black feathers shimmered in the light. Interestingly, they were hopping sideways in the tree trunk actively looking for insects. 
The Hill Mynah has been described as the best talking bird in the world, indeed the champion of mimics! Unlike some other birds, such as the racket tailed drongo, they do not imitate other birds in the wild. In captivity, they can learn to reproduce a range of sounds, including the human voice, with astonishing accuracy and clarity.
As we were watching, it flung its wings and flew away, scattering the medley of calls into the air…
29/09/21, 4:54 pm - Nalini N R: It's perching on the tree and looking so cute! Such a wonderful creativity!

05/10/21, 5:18 pm - Nalini N R: It is a beautiful, well thought of sculpture Sir. Really unique.

13/10/21, 10:03 am - Dr Raguram: Among the many depictions of Goddess Durga slaying the demon Mahishasura, this sculpture at Halebidu is distinctive. Exquisitely chiselled it depicts the story in a narrative form. Goddess Durga is standing triumphantly with her left leg over Mahishasura, the buffalo that has fallen on the ground. Mahishashura is seen emerging from the body of the buffalo in a human form and a trident is piercing him. Seated next to the buffalo is lion, Durga’s vehicle. Goddess Durga has ten arms (some of which are missing or broken), each holding different weapons and objects given to her by various gods. 
The word Mashishasurmardini consists of three Sanskrit words: Mahisha (buffalo), asura (demon), and mardini (slayer). Mahishasura's legend is told in the major text of the Shaktism, Devi Mahatmya, a part of Markandeya Purana. His transformation through various forms represents the never ending chain of desires within us. When one desire is fulfilled another springs and takes control. The conquest of Mahishasura is also symbolic of conquering and winning over such tendencies in us. The story is also told in the Sikh text Chandi di Var, also calledVar Durga di, which many in Sikh tradition believe was included in the Dasam Granth by Guru Gobind Singh.
Durga appears serene, calm and collected after vanquishing the demon in the sculpture. 
Her graceful demeanour is described eloquently in Mahishasuramardini Stotram which was composed by the great sage Adi Shankaracharya around 810 AD. 
कमलदलामल कोमलकान्ति कलाकलितामल भाललते
सकलविलास कलानिलयक्रम केलिचलत्कल हंसकुले ।
अलिकुलसङ्कुल कुवलयमण्डल मौलिमिलद्बकुलालिकुले
जय जय हे महिषासुरमर्दिनि रम्यकपर्दिनि शैलसुते ॥ १४ ॥
The Goddess who is with the radiance like that of the lotus petals, whose forehead is like that of a clear moon
O the one who is skilled in all the arts, and surrounded with attendants, whose steps are followed by dancing swans
O the one whose is with lotuses and Pogada flowers, which are attracting the bees, O the one with beautiful hair
Victory to you, victory to you, the destroyer of Mahishasura, the one with beautiful-braided hair, the daughter of the mountain.
13/10/21, 1:58 pm - Nalini N R: Fantastic sculpture and breathtaking facial expression, ornaments and intricate work. To be slain by an outward force appears to be much more easier than keeping the desires, expectations at check by the mind. Requires constant effort and surely by the grace of Shakti 🙏🏻

14/10/21, 9:52 am - Dr Raguram: Today is Saraswathi Pooja. I had seen many sculptural depictions of Saraswathi during my travels. Personally I would rate the portrayal of the goddess at Gangaikondacholapuram as the most beautiful one. It was by sheer chance and through close observation, I had a glimpse of one of the smallest representation of Saraswathi and it was at Khajuraho.
Khajuraho temples represent the exquisite architectural heritage of the Chandellas. The Varaha temple is among the oldest in the western group of temples and is believed to have been constructed around 900 – 925 A.D. Comparatively small in comparison to its neighbours, its grandeur overwhelms you as you ascend the stairs and enter the little pavilion. Directly under the pyramidal roof which is carved with lotus flower, stands an enormous monolithic image of the boar Varaha, the third incarnation of Vishnu. The image is made out of a single block of sandstone that measures 2.6 metres long and 1.7 metres high. The stone shines like burnished metal and on its surface are 675 miniature figures, carved in twelve well-ordered rows. These figures represent many of the important Gods and Goddesses of the Hindu pantheon. These include ganesha, the seven mothers, the seven sages, the eight guardians of space, the nine planetary divinities, the river goddesses, the seas, the Rudras, and the different forms of Vishnu. 
A low parapet wall surrounds the massive figure of Varaha and as I sat on the soft smoothened stone, my attention was drawn to a small figure carved between the nose and mouth of Varaha. 
I was totally surprised to see a diminutive sculpture of Saraswathi with Veena in her arms!
Though small in size, the sculpture powerfully conveys all the essence of the goddess, much like beej mantras. 
Literally the word ‘beej’ means ‘seed’. In the seed are inherent all the characteristics of the tree. The most important thing about beej mantra is pronunciation and the sound associate with it, as each beej is associated with its own frequency. The more accurate the recitation of the beej mantra, easier it is for one to focus on meditation. “Mantra” in Sanskrit is made up of two syllables: “man” (mind) and “tra” (liberate). Thus in its most literal translation the word “mantra” means “to liberate one’s mind”. Essentially beej mantras are tools for expansion of consciousness utilizing the power of sound vibrations.
The beej is “Aing” for Saraswati and is chanted along with name of the goddess and is prefixed with “Om”, the primordial vedic beej mantra.
ॐ ऐं महासरस्वत्यै नमः ||
Om Aing Mahasaraswatyai Namah |
Meaning: I meditate and bow to Maha Saraswati Devi.
14/10/21, 5:19 pm - Nalini N R: Wonderful image Sir. And so very rich in depiction. Hail their patience to carve them and yours to have captured so beautifully and it appears to be an apt justification for their patience. The narration is so informative.

15/10/21, 9:46 am - Dr Raguram: Dussehra denotes victory of good over evil and there are two stories that are associated with the festival in India. It is said that it was on this day that goddess Durga defeated Mahishasura after a fierce battle lasting for more than nine days. It is also celebrated to mark the victory of Lord Rama over ten-headed demon king of Lanka, Ravana.
One of the most vivid depictions of this battle scene is in the western gallery of Angkor Wat. Extensive, detailed, carefully chiselled bas reliefs depicting various scenes from Ramayana adorn the gallery. The craftsmanship on the sandstone carvings is quite extraordinary.
The first photo depicts Rama waging the battle with his army and the second one portrays Ravana in his chariot. The stylized portrayal of Ravana is quite distinctive from usual depictions and is reflective of Khmer influence. The dynamism in the rendering of the battle scene is truly outstanding.
Ramayana is a living tradition in Cambodia and the epic is called the Reamker. The story is broadly that of the Ramayana, with a few changes. Rama is known as Phreah Ream, Sita as Neang Seda, Laxman as Preah Leak. The three are sent into exile with one of Rama’s stepmothers seeking to get her son crowned as King. Neang Seda is abducted in the forest and the two brothers ally with Sukreep (Sugreeva) to defeat the demon army of Lanka to get her back. Ravana is Krong Reap, the ten-headed king of Lanka. There is an interesting twist in the tale about Hanuman. In India, Hanuman is revered and regarded as the epitome of celibacy. In the Reamker, Hanuman was directing his monkey army to build a bridge of stones to Lanka. He realized that mermaids were stealing the stones. He decides to capture the mermaid princess, Sovanna Maccha, and teach her a lesson. In the process, Hanuman falls in love with the mermaid princess and marries her, later having a son called Mudchanu!
15/10/21, 1:55 pm - Nalini N R: It is an absolute feast for the eyes and food for the brain as it is embedded figures test! The story is an echo of what we know but the last bit is something I can't digest!!

Heavy rain accompanied by thunder and lightning has been an unwavering feature on most days.
On one such evening I spotted this lone bird flying amidst dark, gloomy monsoon clouds…
21/10/21, 4:10 pm - Nalini N R: Yes. Effects of global warming. We might have to face unseen calamities in future. Need to be strong. Wonderful photograph Sir.

04/11/21, 7:33 am - Dr Raguram: Deepavali demonstrates how ancient tales in various epics can vary across the country. There are many narratives around Deepavali. One of them which we grew up with, commemorates the vanquishing of the demon Narakasura by Lord Krishna. As kids we would be woken up at an unearthly hour before sunrise and after an oil bath (which I detest!), wearing the new clothes, we would offer obeisance to the elders and rush to light the fire crackers. Sumptuous lunch with Deepavali sweets will be topped with a special lehiyam (a digestive) prepared for the occasion.
In other accounts it also marks the day that Lord Rama triumphantly returns to Ayodhya with Sita after a prolonged exile of 14yeas and defeating Ravana in the battle. It is said that Ayodhya’s citizens welcomed their prince home with thousands of glowing oil lamps on a moonless night. The word Deepavali has its origins from the Sanskrit word deep (lamp) and avali (row). 
This painting is from Ram Gopal Poddar Chhatri in Ramgarh, Rajasthan which Ahalya and myself visited sometime back. Ramgarh is a sleepy little town surrounded by sand dunes in the Shekhawati region and was once amongst the richest towns in India. It was considered as a centre of learning and was known as Doosra Kashi. It is now a treasure trove of painted havelis and chhatris. Chhatris are basically cenotaphs built to commemorate the memory of the rich and the royalty. Though they look unremarkable from outside, their interiors are full of resplendent paintings. The Ram Gopal Poddar Chhatri , built by the Poddar family in 1872, has exquisite murals depicting scenes from the Ramayana, the life of Lord Krishna, and Ragmalas. This impressive painting on the ceiling in particular depicts the arrival of Lord Rama and Sita to Ayodhya and the celebratory manner with which they were received. The luminous quality of the mural conveys the mood of the occasion wonderfully. 
May the light of the diyas spread joy and happiness…
In the words of Rumi, “If everything around seems dark….look again You May Be The Light!”

10/11/21, 9:08 am - Dr Raguram: Akka Mahadevi was a twelfth century Kannada poet, saint and mystic of the Virashaiva Bhakti movement. She was the first woman to have written vachanas in Kannada which are free verse hymns. Her vachanas end with her ‘ankita’ (signature) calling Shiva as Chennamallikarjuna or as poetically translated by A. K. Ramanujan, “Lord as White as Jasmine”. Over time, Akka’s concept of Chenna Mallikarjuna changed from that of the Puranic Shiva to a formless Divine which finds expression in this vachana, superbly translated by my favourite poet AK Ramanujan. 
I was reminded of this vachana when I saw this landscape enveloped in early morning mist…
YOU ARE THE FOREST
you are all the great trees
     in the forest
you are bird and beast
     playing in and out
     of all the trees
O lord white as jasmine
     filling and filled by all
why don't you
     show me your face?
10/11/21, 1:26 pm - Nalini N R: Beautiful Sir. And how nice it is to be reminded of Akka Mahadevi. She reminds of Mirabai. Yes all pervasive, omnipresent, nirguna tattva.

11/11/21, 2:55 pm - Dr Raguram: If you are wondering what this hole amidst the rocks is… it has a chequered past in the annals of history…
During the 18th century, Chitradurga Fort was under the rule of Madakari Nayaka IV. Hyder Ali, one of the most powerful military leaders of the times, was on a conquering spree and he decided to attack this fort. He tried everything possible to conquer the fort often referred to as Elusuttina Kote (meaning the fort of seven circles). which was one of the most impregnable forts of the time. Finally, he found that there was a small hole (also known as kindi) in one of the walls of the fort. The hole could easily fit one person in it. He also found out that the guard watching this hole goes to his house during lunch hours to have a meal. So he hatched a plan to attack the fort by sending the soldiers one by one through the kindi. One day, Kalanayak, husband of Obavva was guarding the tower as usual. He decided to go home for lunch. While having his meal he asked for water. Since there was no water at home Obavva went to the pond near the kindi, to collect water in a pot. While filling water she heard sounds approaching. She realized that enemy was lined up and was trying to enter into the fort through that hole. Using her presence of mind, she hid behind the hole and waited for the enemy. She just had an ‘Onake’ a long wooden pestle used to pound paddy in the fields, as her weapon. The moment she saw the first soldier coming out of the hole, she hit his head so hard that he died in a single stroke. Similarly, she kept killing all the soldiers who came inside the fort through that tiny hole. The lone women bravely killed all the enemies who tried entering the fort that day.
With the only resource she had, she fought the enemy fiercely and the hole that she guarded is now known as Obavvana Kindi.
The government of Karnataka was planning to honour this women on this day as Onake Obavva Jayanti. This has been held back due to the model code of conduct being in place due to elections to the legislative council. 
Obavva has an enduring presence in the history (irrespective of these issues) and do try and find your way down that hole!
11/11/21, 5:04 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir I have seen it. Got the chance decades back when my uncle was the manager  in Chitradurga branch of SBM. Thanks for the flashback!

12/11/21, 4:59 pm - Dr Raguram: This year, Ragu reaches a milestone on 21st Nov when he turns 70! Yes, it's kind of hard to believe that!
Many of you, dear family and friends were with us to celebrate his 60th birthday. However given the current uncertain situation, we have shelved the idea of an in-person gathering this time, though it would have given us immense joy to have you all with us on the occasion.
Instead, we have created a special Facebook page for you to share your reflections, anecdotes, memories (including photographs!) and anything else that you may like to, about your association with him over these years. Ragu will deeply cherish this. Kindly click on the above link, join the group and delve into your memories!
12/11/21, 6:55 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. I wish him a very contended, happy birthday and many happy  returns of the day and for many more to come in advance 👍🎂Yes I will join and thanks for the invite!

13/11/21, 9:09 am - Nalini N R: What a catchy photograph Sir and the caption. So nice to just become one with nature😌
17/11/21, 8:56 am - Nalini N R: Sir, good morning. Sorry to be disturbing you. Have mailed a brief report on the test finding of Mahesh whom you had referred. The patient is in a hurry as he is very disturbed. Can you please guide them. I will pass on your message to his father.
17/11/21, 8:57 am - Dr Raguram: Sure...I just saw your report and many thanks for your insights
17/11/21, 8:58 am - Nalini N R: Sir. Will you be informing him?
17/11/21, 9:00 am - Dr Raguram: Dr Nalini had sent her impressions. He has very high degree of anxiety which he is unable to handle which is affecting his functions. Need to see a psychiatrist immediately so that appropriate medication can be started
17/11/21, 9:00 am - Dr Raguram: This is the message I had sent him now. Do pass on your findings with the psychiatrist if he is keen to have it!
17/11/21, 9:01 am - Nalini N R: Shall I refer him to Dr. Laxmi Pundit?
17/11/21, 9:05 am - Dr Raguram: Ideal!
17/11/21, 9:05 am - Nalini N R: Thank you Sir.

21/11/21, 7:15 pm - Nalini N R: I remember the days when I was posted in Dr. CSS unit. Patients used to cry whenever they spoke, confided in you. The way you used to make them feel comfortable and your gentle probing words opened the lids. I remember when I used to interview patients in Tamil and abruptly stop when you entered the ward room. I speak adulterated Tamil being a Bangalore Iyengar 😀
21/11/21, 7:37 pm - Dr Raguram: 😃 Ahalya used to say the same thing Nalini! That everytime she comes to the OPD there will be a person crying in front of me!
21/11/21, 7:41 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. Then my observation is correct. I shouldn't be comparing. But those who went to Dr. CSS used to get angry!!

24/11/21, 1:50 pm - Dr Raguram: My interest in the field of psychiatry started quite early during my undergraduate period at JIPMER. I did quite well in ophthalmology and my professor felt that I had the makings of a good ophthalmologist, in spite of my myopia! Undeterred, I pursued my interest and was privileged to have had exceptional teachers who furthered my passion…which over decades I have tried to pass onto my students. 
The field of mental health necessitate providing space for people to share their stories which they are unable to, in their real lives. I have strived to adopt a narrative approach (influenced by the literary legacy…thanks to my mother) in facilitating emergence of untold, unshared tales of suffering. I personally feel that psychiatry cannot be abstracted merely at a molecular level and has to transcend beyond, to incorporate the contexts and life worlds of people. That I have been able to instil this orientation in my students is my greatest satisfaction.
I am filled with gratitude that many of you who have been my co-travellers have taken time to share your thought, feelings, memories and photographs too!
I feel overwhelmed by the depth of affection expressed by all of you…
In the midst of all the demands in life, there is one person who has been beside me all through, for whom I am deeply indebted… and our journey began together in 1978…
24/11/21, 6:13 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. Certain observations of our teachers does have an impact on our learning. We should thank you for helping us imbibe those. Recently a single parent who has a 22yr old ADHD with ODD told me she was happy to talk to me  as none of the professionals earlier listened to her woes. They need a listening ear and an opportunity to work on the clots. Wish you and Madam a happy and long life.

04/12/21, 9:06 am - Nalini N R: Wow. What a flower and what a simile. Yes Sir not just the COVID but the people who are worse than that! They don't follow appropriate rules and what to say about children and adults with problems 🙄
17/12/21, 8:06 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
17/12/21, 9:23 am - Nalini N R: Oh. Beautiful Sir. When it appears there are only dried leaves and thorns, very important we keep walking and as you rightly put it find a bud 👍

18/12/21, 9:49 am - Dr Raguram: Sacred trees form an important part of the cultural heritage of India. Most temples are associated with trees and each one of them has a sacred Sthala Vriksha. 
This particular tree is called audumbara or cluster fig (Ficus racemose). It is easy to spot with copious bunches of fruits growing from its trunk.  Each and every part of this plant has medicinal properties and has been used extensively in Ayurveda. 
Audumbara tree is most commonly associated with the Adi Guru Lord Dattatreya, a deity believed to embody Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma. He is considered to reside at the base of the Audumbara tree in a subtle form. Throughout India, adumbara trees are planted in temples dedicated to Dattatreya. Because of this association, cutting it is considered a sin. If an audumbara tree grows in a house, it is deemed to be a blessing as it signifies the presence of Lord Dattatreya in the household. 
Incidentally today is Datta Jayanti…
18/12/21, 2:06 pm - Nalini N R: Yes. Sir. Today is Datta jayanthi. And thank you for sharing the above. It looks like a painting.
20/12/21, 8:33 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
20/12/21, 8:33 am - Dr Raguram: Today is Arudra Darisanam…
It is believed that on this holy day (Arudra or Thiruvadirai), Shiva performed the cosmic dance as Nataraja. Legend has it that Lord Shiva performed the cosmic dance as Nataraja at Chidambaram for his devotees Adi Shesha and Vyagrapaadar. Adishesha, the seven-hooded serpent on whom Lord Vishnu rests in milky ocean, wanted to witness this divine dance of creation after hearing about it as also Vyagrapaadar who performed penance and tapas to witness the Ananda Tandavam of Nataraja. Lord Shiva granted their request and performed the cosmic dance at Chidambaram. The Ananda Thandavam is said to symbolize the five divine aspects (pancha krityas) of creation, sustenance, dissolution, concealment, and bestowment of grace. 
Although the occasion is associated with Chidambaram, it is celebrated with equal fervour and joy at other temples too. One such shrine is at Uthirakosa Mangai in Ramanathapurm district. The temple houses a 6 feet tall idol of Nataraja which is carved out of emerald, referred to as Maragatha Nataraja. The idol is covered with sandal paste all around the year and no puja is offered to the deity. On the eve of arudra darisanam the sandal paste is removed for a few hours for devotees to have a glimpse of the Lord. 
Ahalya and myself visited this temple early this year and found this beautiful mural of Nataraja on the ceiling of the mandapa leading onto the garbagriha of the Nataraja shrine. There were a few other murals too, but almost all of them had faded over the years due to neglect except this remarkable one.
In almost all depictions of dancing Nataraja, the lord is seen lifting his left foot while balancing over apasmara (or muyalagan) with his right foot. In this painting he is lifting his right foot while balancing on his left one. The only other place where he is depicted similarly is at Madurai Meenakshi temple. The legend has it the Lord danced with his right foot raised on the request of Pandya King by the name of Rajasekhara, a great devotee of Shiva. The king was very much concerned that dancing with permanently grounded right foot that might cause the Lord pain. Responding to his fervent prayers, the lord himself made the shift from left foot to right foot, which is referred to as “Kaal maari aadiya patalam.''
The metaphor of the cosmic dance unifies ancient mythology, religious art and spirituality seamlessly.
As the Dhyaana Shloka in praise if Lord Shiva, the Lord of Dance states:
आंगिकम भुवनम यस्य
वाचिकं सर्व वाङ्ग्मयम
आहार्यं चन्द्र ताराधि
तं नुमः (वन्दे) सात्विकं शिवम् 
Angikam Bhuvanam Yasya 
Vachikam Sarva Vangmayam 
Aaharyam Chandra Taradi
Tam Numah ( Vande) Saattvikam Shivam 
Whose bodily movement is the entire Universe
Whose speech is the language (of the Universe)
Whose ornaments are the moon and the stars
Him, we worship the pure (serene) Lord Shiva!
20/12/21, 1:55 pm - Nalini N R: Sir thank you for a very detailed information about the holy day. A beautiful mural, with a leg lifted up, lovely combination of colours still bright on one side 🙏🏻

25/12/21, 8:00 am - Dr Raguram: The Vatican Museum is a treasure trove. It has 54 galleries with amazing works of art.
As I walked into the Raphael Rooms, I was overwhelmed with the sheer beauty of its frescoes.
Prominent among them was The Disputation over the Blessed Sacrament or the Triumph of Religion which was painted by the artist when he was just 27 year old. It was probably first fresco that Raphael painted at the Vatican. 
In the top most realm is featured God the Father, the Creator of all things visible and invisible. He is depicted holding the world in His hands along with a host of angels by his side. At the centre is God the Son. Seated on a throne of clouds, He gazes benevolently at the viewer. An august aureole encompasses His divine aura. To Christ’s left is seated John the Baptist. He is identified by his traditional iconography, pointing out to Christ as the path to salvation. To Christ’s right Blessed Virgin Mary is seated the with hands pressed at her chest. On either side of them are various saints and prophets. Below Christ’s feet is the Holy Spirit, to whose sides are books of the four Gospels held open. At the bottom is the monstrance which is flanked by groups of theologians in lively debate.
I spent several minutes, unmindful of scores of people passing by, looking at this incredible work of art brimming with life. The clarity, rich colours, harmonious composition and grandeur of this fresco left a lasting impression on me.
It is said that Raphael won the commission to paint the four rooms after stiff competition with both Michelangelo, who was working on the Sistine Chapel and Leonardo da Vinci. This incensed Michelangelo who accused Raphael of plagiarism, spreading rumours that Raphael had sneaked into the Sistine Chapel to have a preview of his work and copied the techniques!   
(BTW this is just one section of the mural!)
25/12/21, 9:08 pm - Nalini N R: No words to appreciate the art Sir. It is so divine, goes beyond any religion! And thanks for the background information. It amplifies the effect!
27/12/21, 8:12 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
27/12/21, 1:09 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. So true Sir. We have bound ourselves because of attachment. But when do we I mean 'I'  work it out?
27/12/21, 7:31 pm - Nalini N R: Wonderful photograph with Ghalib saying. High level thinkers do not contradict each other. Thank you Sir for letting me know that today is his birthday. Worth remembering.

04/01/22, 9:15 am - Dr Raguram: Last year was a demanding one for all of us and there doesn't seem to be a respite around too, with the steady inroads of the new variant of the virus in the New Year.
Some reflections on the year that has gone by at: https://www.profraguram.com/musings--reflections/unmasked-reflections.
Feel free to share your reminiscences about this post and that of the year  too!
04/01/22, 11:36 am - Nalini N R: Sure Sir.
06/01/22, 10:17 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
06/01/22, 3:52 pm - Nalini N R: Wow. Such a catchy photograph, bright eyes, but looking terrified or trying to scare us? Yes Sir. Testing times, prolonged but more confusing due to varied input of information.

09/01/22, 6:01 pm - Dr Raguram: It is curfew time….all noises have ceased..
Amidst the silence, a red vented bulbul announces its presence through its unmistakable call.
As I watch, it raises its head and lets out a quiet phrase of a song.  Starting as a whistle the song soon turns melodious, enlivening the still ambience. 
Its cheery call alleviates the angst of isolation..
Towards the end of his life, the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar had to face similar seclusion when  he was incarcerated by the British and he wrote a beautiful poem about the bulbul:
Bulbul ko bāġhbāñ se na sayyād se gila 
qismat meñ qaid likkhī thī fasl-e-bahār meñ
The bulbul has no complaints from the gardener, or the bird-catcher.
It knows that it is destiny to get caged, even if it is springtime.
Such prescient observation about travails of life during pandemic!
09/01/22, 7:17 pm - Nalini N R: A very apt quote Sir. But many of us are in a constant uneasiness as we can't even cage ourselves!! We have to enjoy the spring as well as face the pandemic head-on!!!

15/01/22, 9:25 am - Dr Raguram: Pongal is essentially a harvest festival and mattu pongal, a day dedicated to cattle, is an integral part of the festivities. Cattle play an important role in agriculture and are an inseparable part of a farmer’s life and. an entire day is dedicated to the cattle, that has been an inseparable part of a farmer's life. On this day, cattle are bathed and decorated and prayers are offered to them as an act of thanksgiving.
As I was savouring the enchanting Nayak era murals inside the main gopuram of Thiruppudaimarudhur, my attention was drawn to this small (size of a postage stamp!),beautifully carved wooden sculpture.  
Today is also a significant day for siblings and is called Kanu Pongal. Sisters pray for the wellbeing of their brothers by offering food to crows. They make small balls of pongal and cooked rice mixed with turmeric and kumkum. These rice balls are then kept on turmeric leaves (Kanu pidi) and served to the crows.
காக்கா பிடிவச்சேன்கண்ணுபிடிவச்சேன், காக்கா கூட்டம் கழிஞ்சாலும் 
எங்க கூட்டம் கலையாமல் இருக்கணும் 
Meaning "I make an offering small balls of food for the crows, even if the family of crow splits, mine should not"
When one would see flocks of crows on other days, they would be significantly scarce on Kanu pongal mornings when they are most sought after!
15/01/22, 11:45 am - Nalini N R: Yes. Sir wonderfully carved! For us kanu Pongal is tomorrow and we feed the balls to cows and pray for the well being of family of origin as well as the husband's family.

18/01/22, 11:12 am - Dr Raguram: Today is Thaipoosam which is believed to be the day when Goddess Parvati gifted her son, Murugan with a Vel (a divine spear) as he headed to the battlefield to end the tyranny of a demon named Soorapadman. 
This is a small panel in the ceiling of Huchchimali temple dating back to 7th century at Aihole which depicts the Lord mounted on a peacock with the divine spear. The entire panel is suffused with vitality and the exquisite expression on his face is quite entrancing
18/01/22, 12:32 pm - Nalini N R: It is indeed Sir. The expression as well as the peacock feathers so beautifully etched out.
21/01/22, 8:52 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
21/01/22, 11:23 am - Nalini N R: Oh such a beautiful sight Sir, smooth blend of colours.  We should be greatful to God for having given us eyesight and heartsight (word doesn't exist)!

22/01/22, 9:58 am - Dr Raguram: Thich Nhat Hanh passed away today…
Over the years, he had a significant impact on me personally and professionally, through his teachings on mindfulness and compassion. 
As he remarked, “The Buddha taught that there is no birth; there is no death; there is no coming; there is no going; there is no same; there is no different; there is no permanent self; there is no annihilation. We only think there is.”
He did not want his followers to build a stupa, but if they did build one, he told them they should add three signs on it: “I am not in here.” “I am not out there either.” “If I am anywhere, it is in your mindful breathing and in your peaceful steps.”
He was a ‘spiritual exemplar’ and a source of inspiration for the environmental movement.
When I took a walk a few years ago in the woods behind Angkor Wat, I was reminded of his words…
22/01/22, 6:30 pm - Nalini N R: He might have left his body but the guiding light lives for ever. We seem to have become blind to what we need to focus on. The photograph is so enchanting Sir.
23/01/22, 9:04 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
23/01/22, 3:09 pm - Nalini N R: Oh...so powerful and a  positive saying. We should be greatful to have had (will be) such a  realised being during our life time. And what an apt fantastic photograph 👍

26/01/22, 8:56 am - Dr Raguram: India is no more a ‘young’ republic.
As we step into the 73rd year of the republic, it is a rather unsettling fact that India’s share of the world’s extreme poor is higher than its share of the world population. 
The World Inequality Database developed by Thomas Piketty and colleagues  reveals an alarming rise in both wealth and income inequality in India.
On this day, let us resolve to address this issue and attempt to narrow the yawning gap…
Plutarch, the Greek philosopher drew attention to it, aeons ago…
26/01/22, 10:55 am - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. A chronic problem. Probably exists as long as humans exist? I am down with COVID.
26/01/22, 11:06 am - Dr Raguram: Sorry to hear of this Nalini..Please do take utmost care
26/01/22, 11:07 am - Nalini N R: Sure Sir. Thank you.
28/01/22, 9:36 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
28/01/22, 1:28 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. A very deep thought destroying our fixed perspective of birth and death.
28/01/22, 2:02 pm - Dr Raguram: Hope you are recovering well
28/01/22, 2:53 pm - Nalini N R: Still on antibiotics Sir. COVID struck me for a day very badly. Literally dead tired. But have been doing house work and I can't rest or sleep on the bed during the day. Had very bad cough. Most of them seem to be having problems with throat and not lungs. Hope it doesn't spring more surprises!
28/01/22, 3:02 pm - Dr Raguram: You’ll settle down well. Don’t worry!
28/01/22, 5:46 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir Thank you.

02/02/22, 11:35 am - Dr Raguram: Wetlands play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and locking it away in plants, root systems and soil. They are also a vibrant biologically diverse ecosystem that sustain a large number of birds, fish and other small creatures which live in harmony. 
For many of us, water simply flows from a tap and we hardly reflect about it beyond this point of contact and consumption. In the process, we have lost a sense of respect for the complex workings of a wetland and the intricate web of life that this simple waterbody supports.
On this World Wetland Day it is imperative that we commit ourselves to conserve and protect this invaluable, precious ecosystem…
02/02/22, 12:06 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. So informative Sir. It's important that we become aware atleast and contribute at an individual level.
02/02/22, 12:06 pm - Nalini N R: What a photograph 👍

05/02/22, 9:22 am - Dr Raguram: Basant Panchami which is being celebrated today heralds the arrival of spring and is imbued with many legends. The most popular association is with Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge, language and music who is deemed to have been born on this day. 
Amongst the many legends concerning Basant Panchami, there is one which revolves around Kama and his role in bringing Lord Shiva and Parvati together. Shiva, mourning the death of his wife Sati/Uma, retreated to the Himalayas and became a reclusive ascetic. Parvati, a reincarnation of Sati, told her father King Himavat that she would marry only Shiva. When informed of this, Shiva declined and walked away without even a glance at Parvati. Undaunted, she waited for many years but couldn’t win him over. The Gods intervened and approached Kamadeva to wake Shiva from his deep meditation and make him fall in love with Parvati. Heeding to their request, Kamadeva shot his five arrows of love, one of which distracted Shiva, who got bewitched by Paravati’s beauty. But as soon as he realized it was Kamadeva’s ruse, he opened the third eye and reduced him to ashes. Deeply distressed by this, Rati undertook an austere penance for 40 days to Shiva. Shiva finally relented and brought Kamadeva back to life on the day of Basant Panchami. On this day Kamadeva and Rati descend on earth ushering in the first fragrant breeze of spring, a season or rebirth and renewal. This is one of the reasons as to why Basant Panchami is also associated with Shringara Rasam.
This beautifully carved sculpture of Kamadeva and Rati is from the western groups of temples at Khajuraho.
It is not a so well-known fact that the Muslim community has been celebrating Basant Panchami since the 12th century A.D. According to legend, Delhi's Chishti Saint Nizamuddin Aulia's young nephew Taqiuddin Nooh died in this month. Stricken with grief, he withdrew himself. The famous court poet, Amir Khusrau, tried to think of ways to brighten the Saint's mood. Then Khusrau noticed some young women dressed in yellow clothes, adorned with yellow flowers of marigold who were celebrating Basant Utsav. Seeing this, an idea struck Khusrau, who immediately donned a yellow ghaagra, covered his face with a chunni, hung garlands of yellow marigold around his neck, went to the Saint and began dancing and singing, “Aaj Basant Manaaley Suhagan…Aaj Basant Manaaley Suhagan”. Seeing this spectacle and knowing it was Khusrau under the woman’s garb who was singing and dancing with gay abandon, Nizamuddin Aulia burst out laughing and his spell of gloom was swiftly lifted. He then went to the grave of his nephew and sang: ‘Ashq rayz ameedan abro bahar’ (‘Shed tears of joy at the coming of spring and the clouds’). Since then, Basant Panchami is being celebrated at the dargah of Nizamuddin Aulia in Delhi and all dargah's of the Chishti order.
Basant, the season of spring, has also inspired many ragas in Indian music. In the north, there are Basant, Basant Bahar and Basant Mukhari and in the south, Vasantam, Hindola Vasantam, Shuddha Vasantam, Vasanta Varali, and Vasanta Bhairavi. Each one of them embodies the spirit of spring.
On this day let us celebrate the cultural syncretism associated with this festival in the subcontinent and spend the day savouring and immersing ourselves in these ragas!
05/02/22, 12:21 pm - Nalini N R: Time to rejuvenate ourselves. Nature offers therapy. We should be open to it. A very informative blend of Basant Panchami. Thank you Sir.

07/02/22, 8:33 am - Dr Raguram: Rathasapthamai which is being celebrated today marks the movement of sun (Surya) turning his “ratham” (chariot) drawn by Saptha (seven) horses from winter solstice to (Dakshinayanam) to the summer solstice (Uttarayanam). 
The worship of Surya is deep rooted in antiquity. Sun has been an object of reverence and worship from the start of human settlements and has been represented symbolically in the pottery and seals of ancient civilizations. The transformation of Surya from a symbolic form to an anthropomorphic figure occurred during the Rig Vedic period. In the process of providing a form to the formless an iconic tradition started and Surya was represented in various human forms across different parts of India. The Agama tradition further specified details of depiction of the sun god. One of the most beautiful representation of Surya according to the Suprabhedagama tradition is in at the Virupaksha temple in Pattadakkal. This temple was built by Queen Loka Mahadevi after the successful military campaign of King Vikramaditya II against the Pallavas. Within the dark interiors of the temple, the inner ceiling in the east has this intricately carved image of Surya. 
At the center of this intricately carved bas-relief is Surya, the sun god, riding a seven-horse chariot. He is standing majestically in the chariot holding a lotus flower with each hand, and surrounding his head is a halo of rays emanating outwards. Behind him are the two-headed mythical creatures (Makaras), disgorging yakshas. Accompanying him are his consorts Ushas (Goddess of Dawn) and Chhaya (Goddess of Shadow). Both Ushas and Chhaya are pointing their bows upwards, indicating that they are fighting the darkness. At the bottom of the panel is Aruna, Surya’s charioteer, holding the reins of seven horses, representing the days of the week. The seven horses are named as Gayatri, Brihati, Ushnih, Jagati, Trishtubha, Anushtubha and Pankti. 
Perhaps one of the most exquisite delineation of the attributes of the sun god is in the composition of Muthiswamy Dikshitar ‘Surya Murte Namostute’ set to raga Sourashtram.  
The spiritual connotations of the Sun have been brought out vividly by Rabindranath Tagore: “One day while I stood watching at early dawn the Sun sending out its rays from behind the trees, I suddenly felt as if some ancient mist had in a moment lifted from my sight and the morning light on the face of the world revealed an inner radiance of joy. The invisible screen of the commonplace was removed from all things and all of mankind and this ultimate significance was intensified in my mind and this is the definition of beauty.”
07/02/22, 6:33 pm - Nalini N R: Sorry for the delayed reaction Sir. COVID has slowed down my pace. Rabindranath Tagore's lines helps us to imagine what he would have experienced! Sun rejuvanates and kindles hope 🙏🏻

08/02/22, 9:34 am - Dr Raguram: Bhishma or Bhishma Pitamaha was one of the most charismatic characters in Mahabharata and was respected by both the Kauravas and the Pandavaas. His original name was Devavrata and he was the son of King Shantanu and Ganga. His father wanted to marry a fisherwoman, Stayavati, who insisted that only sons born to her should succeed Shantanu to the throne. To facilitate this, Devavrata took a vow of celibacy for life and also pledged to serve anyone who ascended the throne of Hastinapura. 
In the battle of Mahabharata, the Pandavas were unable to make any headway even after many days mainly due to the skill and valour of Bhishma. At this point, Shikhandi, who was born a woman, positioned herself in front of Arjuna to fight against Bhishma. Bhishma knew that Shikhandi was born a woman, who had a grudge against Bhishma because he had interfered in her marriage. Seeing Shikhandi, Bhishma refused to fight and was felled by Arjuna’s arrow. It is believed that Bhishma himself had hinted at this ploy while Arjuna and Krishna met him the previous night.
Arjuna’s arrows had already formed a bed and Bhishma did not fall to the ground. Arjuna used more arrows to form a pillow. As the battle raged, Bhishma held on till Uttarayana to die as he had the boon of ‘Ichcha Mrityu’, the ability to choose one’s time of death.
It is believed that Bhishma revealed the Vishnu Sahasranama Stotram to the Pandavas in the presence of Lord Krishna, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, on this day which is celebrated as Bhishma Ashtami. 
The battle of Kurukshetra is carved into the southern section of the west gallery, which is located on the perimeter of the lower level of the Angkor Wat. This is a depiction of Bhishma on a bed of arrows. Interestingly it is said that a beam of sunrays falls on this image during the winter solstice
08/02/22, 12:27 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. He waited till Uttarayana Punyakala. The carving of Bhishmacharya is beautiful and rare. In fact we celebrate Ratha saptami today. Thanks again for the reminder of the event in Mahabharata.

14/02/22, 8:23 am - Dr Raguram: As John Paul Young sang, “Love is in the air, everywhere I look around, Love is in the air, every sight and every sound.” It is also the time when love turns into serious business in the guise of Valentine’s Day. But what is the real story behind Valentine?
While Valentine’s Day might be associated with romantic love, the real story behind its namesake, Valentine, is full of bloodshed and heart break. He was reported to have had healing powers, especially for those ailing from epilepsy. According to one legend, Valentine signed a letter “from your Valentine” to his jailer’s daughter, whom he had befriended and healed her from blindness. Another legend states that he defied the emperor’s orders and secretly married couples to spare the husbands from war. Unhappy with his actions, Emperor Claudius ordered that he be put to death and he was beheaded. Neither written nor material evidence from the pre-medieval period associates Valentine with love or lovers. Scholars credit Geoffrey Chaucer for turning Valentine into the patron of love. In his Parlement of Foules he wrote, “seynt Volantynys day/ Whan euery bryd comyth there to chese his make. (Saint Valentine’s day, when every bird comes there to choose his mate.) Chaucer was a major influencer in his day – after him, everyone began calling their beloved “Valentine” and writing love poems on 14 February.
Closer home there is a more suitable mythological character, Kamadeva. He has many names: he is called “Ragavrunt”, “Ananga”, “Kandarp”, “Manmath”, “Mansija”, “Madana”, “Ratikant”, “Pushpvan” and “Pushpdhanv”. Kama has a variety of meanings, ranging from sensuality to aesthetic enjoyment, although its overtones are predominantly sexual in the popular imagination. It is also a misconception that kama means love, kama literally means trishNa(Sanskrit), desire or thirst. 
There are striking parallels between the depiction of Kamadeva and Cupid. Both carry a bow and a quiver of arrows. Kamadeva’s bow is made of sugarcane and is sugar coated with the bowstring soaked in honey. Arrows are decorated with flowers and the flowers on his arrows are:  Aravinda(White Lotus), Ashoka, Cuta (Mango Flower), Navamalika (Jasmine), and Nilotpala (Blue Lotus). Kamadeva carries five kind of arrows with him: Maran, Stambhan, Jrumbhan, Shoshan and Ummadan. Kamadeva’s five arrows are associated with five effects. The first arrow is aimed at the heart and it causes initial excitement and a youthful cheerfulness. The second arrow is aimed at the lips and it causes one to cry out of this excitement. The third arrow is aimed at the head/brain and it makes one lose their mind / go crazy with love. The fourth arrow is aimed at the eyes which makes one see things. The fifth arrow is basically designed to hit anywhere causing the person to totally be absorbed with love. 
There are no temples solely dedicated to Kamadeva in India. However, in Assam there is a shrine for him called Madana-Kamadeva temple. Situated in a dense forest, this temple has some marvellous sculptures but unfortunately the structure is quite dilapidated. 
This particular sculpture of Kamadeva is from a small temple at Krishnapuram in Tirunelveli district. It is an astounding sculpture crafted out of a single stone and is exquisitely carved. He is holding the bow made of sugarcane, which is so well hewn that if one drops a pin into the hole on top of the bow, it comes out at the bottom! Unfortunately, in the process of testing this out, people have broken part of the bow, the bane of many a sculpture in India. The sculpture now is encircled within a steel enclosure to prevent further damage to it. 
There is a mantra dedicated to Kamadeva which reads:
Aum Kamadevaye Vidmahe
Pushpa banaye dhimahi
Tanno Ananga Prachodayat
Oh let me meditate to the God of Love
He who carries an arrow made of flowers
May that Ananga (who is without a body) bestow upon me higher intellect and illuminate my mind.
Purusartha is a key concept in Hinduism and refers to the four important goals of human life. They are Dharma (righteousness, moral values); Artha (prosperity, economic values); Kama (pleasure, love) and Moksha (liberation, spiritual values). The path to enlightenment or Moksha is facilitated by the harmonious interaction of Dharma, Artha, and Kama. 
Ultimately, the highest Kama is the longing for Oneness with the Divine.
14/02/22, 6:18 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. What a detailed description Sir. But the story behind Valentine's day leaves one with bitter taste in mouth. Our culture has more angles to the concept of love and it is one of the goals, in the limits of Dharma. Thank you Sir for throwing light on the details and the sculpture which is so bright and glowing!

15/02/22, 1:52 pm - Dr Raguram: On the death anniversary of Mirza Ghalib let us recollect these words of his...timeless and so appropriate in these times...
15/02/22, 6:58 pm - Nalini N R: Very true Sir. We are sliding downwards and going far away from higher ideals and sticking to useless illogical practices.
16/02/22, 4:04 pm - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
16/02/22, 4:04 pm - Dr Raguram: Siva is worshipped in various anthropomorphic forms. His facial depiction usually encompasses five different representations: Satyojatam, Vamadevam, Tatpurusham, Esanam and Agoram. The last one in turn has five forms, one of which is Gajasamharamurti. He is also worshipped as Ayurdevata, which is mentioned in Ayush suktam of Rig Veda which also mentions Him by the Sanskrit name Krithivasa. 
According to legend, once 30,000 sages, who were meditating at Tarukavanam, challenged the omnipotence of Lord Siva. They created many wild creatures through sacrificial fire to kill Siva, but in vain. Finally, they sent an elephant demon (Gajasura). But Siva, dwarfing Himself entered the elephant’s body and then assumed his original form only to slay the demon and emerged wearing its skin. Sages who saw this divine event shed their pride and arrogance and took refuge in Siva. Symbolically the mad elephant represents, anger, ignorance and pride. When we take refuge in Siva, he slays all these demons within us. 
There is also a reference to Gajasamharamurti in Kalidasa’s ‘Kumarasambhavam.’ According to it was demon Nila who came in the form of an elephant to kill Siva. Learning about it, Nandi ordered Veerabadra to slay Nila. Veerabadra killed the demon and presented the skin (charma) to Siva, who wore it while on his way to vanquish Antakasura. Hence he is also referred to as Gajacharmambara.
The only temple dedicated to Gajasamharamurti is at Vazhuvoor in Mayiladuthurai district, Tamil Nadu and it is believed to be the site where Lord Siva killed Gajasura, the elephant demon, and wore his hide around him. 
There are many sculptural depictions of Gajasamharamurti. The most attractive one is at the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebid. He is depicted in a dancing posture with his right foot on the demon Gajasura. The lifted left leg is so delicately carved that one can even see the arch of the heel! The two hands on the top are positioned high, holding the elephant’s skin which is surrounding the God like a Prabavalli. He is holding trishul, damaru, kapala and Khadaga amongst others. He is wearing a tall crown with several small skulls inscribed on it. Several rings can be seen on his fingers. A highly ornate belt called Mekhala is adoring his midriff. As he dances inside the elephant his jewellery is swinging too! Nandi is on his right hand side, looking out. On the left are various Ganas playing the drums. One of them is even adjusting the ropes of the drum to tune it! To his right is Nandi and to the left two ganas playing mrudanga can be seen in the lower part of the carvings. The entire sculpture is suffused with elegance conveying a delicate sense of balance.
Today is Masi magam and among the many legends associated with it, is that of Gajasamharam, reminding us to destroy our ego and surrender ourselves at the feet of the divine.
16/02/22, 4:40 pm - Nalini N R: I will read again in detail Sir.
16/02/22, 9:53 pm - Nalini N R: Such a beautiful rendering Sir. I didn't know this. I think all the Puranas Vedas Upanishads talk about the same, the jist that you have highlighted in the end. We need to keep reminding ourselves the same and sampoorna sharanagathi helps in destroying our ahankara. I took time to read the above and observing the sculpture. No words to express the deftness of the sculpture.
17/02/22, 12:58 pm - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
17/02/22, 12:58 pm - Dr Raguram: Yesterday while detailing about Gajasamharamurti I had mentioned  that the event took place in Tharukavanam. The rishis living in the forest became very arrogant as they had mastered all the 'Vedas', 'Agamas' and 'Shastras' and could raise powerful creatures from the sacrificial fires to do their bidding. Lord Siva wished to show these rishis their limitations and appeared as a handsome mendicant. This created chaos in 'Tharukavanam' as the wives of the rishis fell under the spell of this charming, handsome mendicant. The rishis became very angry, raised an elephant to destroy Siva, which he eventually destroyed.  
This very small frieze in Sri Vanamamalai Perumal temple at Nanguneri dating back to 13th century, depicts Siva dancing as a mendicant in the middle with ganas at his feet surrounded by rishipatnis.
17/02/22, 1:09 pm - Nalini N R: Oh...when 'I know everything' gets into head this is what happens. Whether it is a Rishi or mortals like us 🙄 We have forgotten what our culture has given us, the message given by  scriptures and sculptures.

21/02/22, 12:07 pm - Dr Raguram: I love Bar Headed Geese! They are amazing travellers! They breed in massive colonies near mountain lakes in Mongolia and when the cold starts to overcome them, fly thousands of miles to winter in South Asia and come down to South India too in large numbers. As someone suggested these dainty birds are able achieve what the fearsome Genghis Khan was unable to do!
When we heard that they are back in Hadinaru Lake near Mysore, myself and Ahalya took a much needed break after a year of prolonged stay at home and headed there. We were welcomed by their chorus of clucks as we went near the lake and it was such a wonderful sight to see hundreds of them resting and frolicking in the water. A sight to behold…
I had written a detailed account about these birds…do have a look at:  https://www.profraguram.com/musings--reflections/soaring-high-on-graceful-wings
21/02/22, 6:38 pm - Nalini N R: Sure Sir.
24/02/22, 9:08 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
24/02/22, 9:08 am - Dr Raguram: The formidable looking dwarapalaka are the door-keepers of temples. The name dwarapalaka is a combination of two words Dwaram and Palakas: Dwaram stands for door or entrance and the Palakas for guardians. Carved in pairs, they are the protectors of the main deity and are typically depicted as huge and robust warriors. One can find them at the entrance to the temple and also at the doorway to the sanctum. Their iconography differs according to whether they are in a Shiva or Vaishnava shrines.
One of the outstanding representations of dwaraplakas is at the 14th century vaidyanatheshwara temple at talakadu. Here he is seen holding trishula in his top right hand and a damaru entwined by a snake is in his top left hand. His right hand at the front holds gada (mace) and his left hand at the front is in abhaya mudra. He is wearing a Kirita, and the entire body is adorned with exquisitely chiselled jewellery.
This dwarapalaka is quite distinctive from any others! Look carefully at his chest and abdomen and you can recognize the face of nandi, the vahana of Shiva!
I stood there for some time, totally mesmerized by this marvellous sculpture by an unknown artisan who seems to have dipped his chisel in his soul to create this masterpiece.
24/02/22, 6:45 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. It is very different when we visit such places and glance at them from looking at the clarity in your photographs. I was wondering at the chiseled portions of knee cap and ankle!

25/02/22, 7:47 pm - Nalini N R: Apt reflection in the present scenario but when it is sheer madness in the name of the above, who will bell the cat?

01/03/22, 8:58 am - Dr Raguram: According to one of the legends, Mahashivaratri is the day Lord Shiva got married to Parvati.
Goddess Sati took birth as Parvati, the daughter of Himavan to marry Lord Shiva. She practised intense penance to win over Lord Shiva's heart. After years of Tapasya at the Gauri Kund, Parvati finally succeeded in convincing Lord Shiva to accept her as his wife. Shiva reportedly proposed to Parvati at Guptakashi and then tied the nuptial knot at Triyuginarayan. The celestial marriage of Lord Shiva and Parvati took place in the presence of Lord Brahma, who turned a priest to conduct the ceremony and Lord Vishnu, who performed the duties of the bride's brother. The Agni that was witness to the wedding ceremony still exists in the form of an  eternal flame, Akhand Dhuni, near the temple.
This 17th century mural at Veerabadra temple at Lepakshi depicts the marriage of Shiva and Parvati. Shiva is shown wearing the characteristic tiger skin, carrying the deer and axe in the upper hands. Parvati, escorted by attendants stands in front of Shiva, her head slightly bent. She is seen carrying a lotus in her left hand while offering the right hand to Shiva. Do not fail to notice a diminutive Nandi jumping joyfully between the couple! To the left of Paravati is her father Himavan who is carrying a kamandala in his raised hand and is about to solemnize the wedding by pouring water on the hands of the couple. Brahma is seen sitting in front of the sacred fire performing various rituals. 
When I first visited the temple, the murals covered with years of dirt and soot were hardly visible in the dark interiors of the place. Thankfully a careful restoration has brought them alive now, even though some details have been lost. Unquestionably they are the finest examples of mural paintings of the Vijayanagar period.
04/03/22, 12:01 pm - Dr Raguram: At Paadhai (our NGO), STREE is one of the ambitious projects for this year. STREE (She Transforms Routine to Equitable Entrepreneurship), is a programme to help women entrepreneurship by enabling homemakers and the like to contribute to their family incomes and become financially independent.

08/03/22, 10:38 am - Dr Raguram: Feminity was not viewed as a weak trait in Hindu mythology. The greatest example is Goddess Durga. She transformed herself into many different avatars, depending on the situation she had to confront, much like a woman in modern times deftly negotiating many different, demanding roles. This dexterity and resolve needs to be recognised, appreciated and celebrated…not just on this International Woman’s Day!
This exquisite sculpture of Durga is from Bhoganandeeswara temple.
08/03/22, 11:56 am - Nalini N R: Very true Sir. Parents play an important role in nurturing the above and partners to be aware of it. Wonderful sculpture, not just to be idolized!

18/03/22, 11:58 am - Dr Raguram: Colours play an important role in the festival of Holi. They add vitality to the festival, making it one of the most vibrant of celebrations. Each of the colours is deemed to have a symbolic significance. Blue for instance is the colour of Krishna's complexion and also of the sky and the oceans. 
And colours are the smiles of nature.
Birds are beautiful jewels in the sky. There are many brightly coloured birds in the world, and the most flamboyant ones are the parrots. During our birding sojourn in Australia, Ahalya and myself saw some of the most multihued parrots, prominent among them being the Rainbow Lorikeet. 
Rainbow Lorikeet, definitely deserves its name! True to its name, one can see all the colour palettes of rainbow in its feathers. Its head is deep blue with a greenish-yellow nuchal collar, and the rest of the upper parts (wings, back, and tail) are green. The chest is orange/yellow in colour. The belly is deep blue, and the thighs and rump are green. Their species name, haematodus, comes from the Latin word for blood, and is a reference to the rich red found on its breast.
The colour of the feathers of birds serves various functions; thermoregulation, climatic adaptation and a fine balance between sexual signalling and camouflage. Birds need to balance being attractive to potential mates while having some kind of camouflage against potential predators. When hunted from above, the Rainbow Lorikeet blends with the foliage of the trees with its green back. It has been suggested that the colourful patches confer evolutionary advantage in courtship and mate recognition. 
Rainbow lorikeets have two unique features. They possess a tongue with brush-type tissues helping them to collect nectar and pollen. The other distinctive feature is their agile legs which help them to hang upside-down and feed on bottlebrush flowers. It is a dazzling sight when flocks of them fly with the rays of the sun streaming through their gorgeous plumage!
On the occasion of Holi, in the words of Maya Angelou, let us “Try to be a rainbow in someone’s cloud.”
18/03/22, 1:17 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. Beautiful Sir. Real feast for the eyes and mind. Thanks for letting us know about this parrot. God's creation is unimaginable. Our duty is to turn our eyes and tune our mind to it. And what a saying 👍

07/04/22, 11:02 am - Dr Raguram: Each of the lecture theatres in JIPMER were named after a historical medical luminary and their portrait used to be displayed outside. Every time I entered theatre Bernard I used to be fascinated by a painting which depicted him in a deeply reflective mood. Claude Bernard was an exceptional man. He posited that there is a delicate balance between physiological processes within the human body and the environment outside of it. He termed them as ‘milieu interior’ and ‘milieu exterior’. He drew attention to how physiological mechanisms are crucial in maintaining constancy of the internal environment to sustain a status of health in response to changes in the external environment.
Understandably over the years medical professionals have focused their attention on the internal environment to preserve individual health. Unfortunately, in the process, the crucial role of the environment in which we are immersed everyday in our lives and its vital role in modulating individual health has been lost sight of.
On the occasion of the World Health today and on the background of looming climate changes, it is imperative to remind ourselves that climate crisis is health crisis. Our health is intricately related to health of the planet and we should strive to make every effort to conserve and protect the Mother Earth.
07/04/22, 7:24 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. Yes Sir. It is something which all of us should focus on. I think we are already in the downward trend and contributed heavily to the extremes in the climate. Man has become extremely self centered and doesn't know he is destroying himself by showing a callous attitude to our mother earth🤔

09/04/22, 11:36 am - Dr Raguram: Navratri is celebrated in different seasons, five times a year across our country. They are Chaitra Navratri, Ashadha Navratri, the Sharada Navratri, and the Paush/Magha Navratri. Of these, the Sharada Navratri heralds the onset of autumn and the Chaitra Navratri the season of spring. Today is the date of Shukla Paksha Ashtami of Chaitra month, also referred to as Maha Ashtami, dedicated to Goddess Durga.
One of the outstanding depictions of Goddess Durga slaying the demon Mahishasura is at the 13th century Hoysala temple at Somanathapura. The Devi is seen triumphantly standing on top of the he buffalo that appears to have fallen on the ground. Mahishasura is seen emerging from the body of the buffalo. If you look carefully, you can notice Mahisha’s intestines coming out of his stomach! Standing to the left of the Goddess is her vehicle, a partly broken lion, which is seen killing an asura. Even though some of the arms Goddess Durga are missing or broken, the vigour and vitality in depiction is a tribute to the sculptor Mallithamma, who sculptures adorn many Hoysala temples.
09/04/22, 1:02 pm - Nalini N R: Sir, someone is calling up asking for Prasanna Swamy's report. I told that person that I cannot and they can check with you.
09/04/22, 9:34 pm - Nalini N R: It was some one from rehabilitation unit of CADABAMS. They want me to talk to the patient as suggested by Dr. Madhukar.
09/04/22, 9:48 pm - Dr Raguram: Ask them to talk to me
09/04/22, 9:58 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. I will.

India has many interesting places associated with Ramayana where the legend comes alive. 
On the occasion of Ramanavami, let me take you to Avani, a small town in Kolar, Karnataka. 
Soaked in antiquity the 10th century Ramalingeshwara temple at Avani and the looming hill behind it is the site of Uttara Ramayana and has incredible stories associated with it.
Read on and savor the rich architectural heritage of the place.
Kindly post your comments in the blog and not in Facebook!
10/04/22, 1:23 pm - Nalini N R: It is a beautiful sculpture and what it has to convey has not disappeared despite the fact that it is disfigured! Thank you Sir for this piece of information.

18/04/22, 8:30 am - Dr Raguram: Today is the World Heritage Day and the theme this year is “Heritage and Climate”. 
On this occasion let me introduce you to Ashtadikpalakas, divine guardians of eight directions of the universe.
The ceiling near the sanctum of a temple is often considered to symbolically represent the sky and Ashtadikpalakas are sculpted in it.
One of most exquisite depictions of them is at Ramalingeshwara temple at Avani.
Do read on, have a glimpse of these guardians and feel free to post your comments in the blog! https://www.profraguram.com/musings--reflections/ashtadikpalakas

23/04/22, 9:58 am - Dr Raguram: Indian Coral Tree is among the earliest flowering trees in spring and is extremely colourful and picturesque. It adds colour to the skyline with its conspicuous vibrant red coloured flowers. When in bloom the coral tree is like an aviary, attracting numerous bird species like this Golden Fronted Leaf Bird here. 
Referred to as a Mandara tree it is one of the five heavenly trees, Panchavriksha in Indira’s garden in Swarga. After Krishna had brought the Parijata Tree from heaven for Satyabhama, Rukminin insisted that he should bring the Mandara tree for her!
23/04/22, 7:08 pm - Nalini N R: Fantastic Sir. Everytime you send something like this I wonder why some brains look at the wrong side of everything. I feel sorry for such people 🤔

29/04/22, 11:54 am - Dr Raguram: As Charles Baudelaire commented, "Dancing Is Poetry With Arms And Legs"
Nothing illustrates this more than this beautiful sculpture of dancing Lakshmi at Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura.
On this International Dance Day...
29/04/22, 1:09 pm - Nalini N R: Fantastic sculpture Sir. Such an apt example which highlights out heritage giving a divine touch to the art.
30/04/22, 6:54 am - Dr Raguram: Sculptors often see the divine in the stone, carve them with passion and then set them free…
On the occasion of the World Sculpture Day, let me take you to a quaint village which is steeped in history where every house is a sculptor’s gallery!

01/05/22, 8:59 am - Dr Raguram: Balmy Alley in the Mission District of San Francisco has some of the finest murals and street art that I have ever seen. 
On the occasion of the May Day, let me draw attention to one of the most iconic murals of the alley, Naya Bihana or A New Dawn. It depicts three generations of Nepalese women toiling in the fields beneath the Himalayas. To the right, one determined-looking woman breaks the chains of oppression while others stand with their fists in the air. It is a persuasive visual narration of empowerment of a community collectively resisting injustice and regaining leverage to effect change.
01/05/22, 12:44 pm - Nalini N R: Wonderful depiction of determination Sir👌🏻

03/05/22, 10:26 am - Dr Raguram: Basavanna whose birthday is today, was a revolutionary saint and an ardent social reformer. He composed vachanas in simple language, which are very thought provoking. This particular one translated by AK Ramanujan is my favourite.
He outlines as to how various parts of a temple are analogous to several body parts and a temple is the primordial template of the human body. Though the rich may construct temples to show their wealth and power, Basavanna highlights that our body is itself is a temple which houses the immortal god. 
The last lines: things standing shall fall, but the moving will ever stay, is so prescient. A temple built with stones and mortar might fall but the immortal spirit will move on, not confined to the physical space.
Words from a thousand years ago never ring more true now….
03/05/22, 11:29 am - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. It so happens that this month appears to be very auspicious. Today is Basava Jayanthi, followed by Sri Ramanujar Jayanthi, Jagadguru Sri Adishankara and Buddha Jayanthi. People have limited themselves to worshipping idols and forgotten about ways of leading life.

05/05/22, 7:58 am - Dr Raguram: Dedicated to Lord Cheluvanarayana Swamy or Thirunarayana, Melukote is a small but beautiful temple in Mandya district, Karnataka. On the occasion of 1005th birth anniversary of Sri Ramanujacharya, let us explore his association to this place.
Sri Ramanujacharya was one of the most important exponents of the Sri Vaishnavism tradition and spent major part of his life at Srirangam.  To avoid persecution, Sri Ramanujacharya had to leave the place and after travelling along the course of Cauvery, he reached Thondanur, a flourishing centre of Jain theology, ruled then by the Hoysala king Bitti Deva. Bittideva, a Jain king of the region became his ardent disciple and in the process, changed his own name to Vishnuvardhana. According to the legend one day Sri Ramanujacharya was running short of the white sand to put a holy mark on his forehead. That night, Lord Tirunarayana came in his dream and instructed Sri Ramanujacharya to go to Melukote where he would find the white sand as also a deity of Lord Tirunarayana. After intense search, the deity of the Lord Tirunarayana was found near an anthill and a temple was erected over the it, over time. 
Prior to this, there was an old temple in Melukote which was destroyed by invaders who plundered its wealth and also took away the Utsavamurthy, ‘Cheluva Pillai’ to Delhi. Lord Tirunarayana once again appeared in Sri Ramanujacharya’s dream and instructed him to bring the deity back to Melukote. He travelled to Delhi and found that the idol was with the king’s daughter who was treating the deity as her spouse. When she came to know that the idol was about to be taken away from her, she could not bear the separation and travelled back to Melukote along with it. After reaching Melukote, she started meditating in front of the temple as she was not allowed inside. Noticing her intense devotion and dedication, Sri Ramanujacharya allowed her inside and she merged with the Lord. Sri Ramanujacharya installed an idol of Bibi Nachiyar which is worshipped along with the main deity, even today.
This legend is remarkably parallel to that of Tulukka Nachiyar in Srirangam. 
These narratives inform us that in spite of instances of intense interfaith crises, there have always been moments of remarkable synergy in our history.
05/05/22, 5:27 pm - Nalini N R: Thank you Sir for the wonderful narrative. Sri Ramanujacharya never discriminated on the basis of caste which was at its peak even then. He was of firm conviction that everyone has a right to attain Lord's feet🙏🏻
06/05/22, 9:34 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
06/05/22, 9:34 am - Dr Raguram: Yesterday was Ramanuja Jayanthi and today is 1234th birth anniversary of Adi Shankaracharya. While Ramanjua strove to make spirituality more religious, Shankara was motivated by the desire to make religion more spiritual. One catered to human vulnerability and fulfilment in the life lived now, the other focused on the search for ultimate truths. 
Though Shankara acknowledged the innate human need for religious practices, he also urged that these should not impede the quest for exploring one’s divine nature and that of the Supreme Self, as this verse from his magnum opus, Vivekachudamani illustrates…
06/05/22, 12:52 pm - Nalini N R: True Sir. Man got stuck at the level of religious practices, more tangible and became more worldly instead of striving towards the higher truth🙏🏻

07/05/22, 10:47 am - Dr Raguram: On his birthday I was re-reading Tagore’s Stray Birds. It is a collection of some 300 short poems, each one of them a sparkling gem! They are deeply meditative reflections on myriad manifestations of nature…be it birds, flowers, sun, moon…this one is about clouds..
07/05/22, 5:41 pm - Nalini N R: Oh what a photograph Sir. No words. But words from a writer, poet, artist like Rabindranth Tagore apt for the photograph!

“When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence..."
11/05/22, 1:48 pm - Dr Raguram: Another initiatve from Wayanad Girijana Seva Trust which we support. "SRI SARDA SEVA MEDICAL CLINIC" under Wayanad Girijana Seva Trust has started functioning at Niravilpuzha town Wayanad from 1st May 2022 onwards with medical consultation & Lab/ pharmacy etc.in full fledge everyday from 07.30 morning to 4.30 evening except Sunday.

16/05/22, 8:19 am - Dr Raguram: On the Buddha Purnima day, it is interesting to note that all the important events in his life were associated with trees. He was born under a sal tree and he experienced his first deep meditation under a rose-apple tree. Years later, his enlightenment took place under a Bodhi tree and he attained Mahaparinirvana lying between two mighty sal trees. Buddha considered a kind person to be like a banyan tree, growing along road side offering respite and succour to the tired traveller with its cool shade. 
This panel in Sanchi portrays a banyan (Nyagrodha) tree with a throne beneath (representing Buddha). For several weeks after attaining the enlightenment, Buddha was hesitant and diffident to make known The Truth to the world. Then Brahma, Indra, the four Lokapalas (Regents of the Four Quarters) and the archangels of the heavens approached him and implored him to expound his revelations. The four figures side by side in the foreground are the four Lokapalas. The nyagrodha tree symbolizes the principle that a seemingly insignificant cause can produce a great effect, just as the tiny seed of the nyagrodha develops into an sprawling tree.
Nyagrodha also figures in an interesting narrative in the Chandogya Upanishad.  Uddalaka a great saint sent his son Svetaketu when he was twelve, to the ashram of a renowned teacher for studies. Svetaketu was a bright boy and in twelve years, he mastered all scriptures that could be taught. Seeing a man proud of his knowledge, his father asked him, “Do you know that by knowing which all can be known? That which cannot be taught but can only be known?” He asked the boy to get a fruit of the Nyagrodha tree, cut it open, and remove a seed. He then asked him what he saw. “Nothing” the boy replied. “That is the subtlest essence of all. That essence that you do not perceive, from that arises the big tree. That essence is the reality. That essence is the Spirit of whole universe. That which cannot be explained or taught but by knowing which you know all there is to know.”. Then the Sage took his son in to his arms and whispered this great truth in to his ear, “You are THAT, Svetaketu. Tat Tvam Asi
Religious orientations and teachings may differ but the search for ultimate reality stems from the underlying interconnectedness of individual and universal consciousness. 
As Thich Nhat Hanh commented perceptively about this quest, “The mind can go in a thousand directions, but on this beautiful path, I walk in peace. With each step, the wind blows. With each step, a flower blooms.”

16/05/22, 12:59 pm - Nalini N R: Sir I have always been drawn towards Gautham Buddha's teachings and it is heartening to know from the above the connectedness to the nature. It is so important to start walking in the path with a still focus. Thank you Sir for your attempts to bring our focus back to the long spiritual journey.

18/05/22, 6:24 am - Dr Raguram: I lose myself in a museum!
Whenever we trave,l we make it a point to savor the museums of the place, leisurely.
As you stroll through a museum, it becomes part of your, somehow.
Museums are places of discovery and learning. Visit to a museum often is a part of a student’s life from early days, abroad. It is a wonderful sight to see children milling around the exhibits curiously, while being briefed about them by their teachers.
Less said about the status of museums in India, the better. There is an overwhelming sense of neglect in many of them, with some notable exceptions. The exhibits are often displayed haphazardly with poor lighting with little information about them. Gallery walks are a rarity in most.
Madhya Pradesh Tribal Museum at Bhopal is an outstanding example of how a museum should be! Designed by Revathi Kamath, pioneer of mud architecture in India, it is a series of aesthetically designed colorful galleries that offer interesting and informative insights into the rich cultural heritage of various tribes of the region. One can spend hours amidst the beautifully lit artifacts and exhibits. 
Take a walk through this museum at: https://photos.app.goo.gl/eh4ChAvfXt72BMRJ7

20/05/22, 7:20 am - Dr Raguram: The third friday in May is considered as the Endangered Species Day, to draw attention to threatened species and the importance of protecting them. It was established by David Robinson and the Endangered Species Coalition in 2006. 
One of the critically endangered bird species in India is the Great Indian Bustard. Once in the running to become India’s national bird, it is literally fluttering for survival. Its prime habitat, the grasslands are being slowly denuded due to various industrial projects. The Great Indian Bustard is considered among the largest flying birds in the world and because of its large size they usually take low flights which often bring them fatally in touch with overhead power lines. Even though the Supreme Court had stipulated that the power lines need to be taken underground, the progress has been very slow as companies continue to violate the order. The situation is not helped by the presence of feral dogs which eat the bustard’s eggs and also attack the young ones. Earlier found across several states of India, the numbers have dramatically declined over the years, especially in peninsular India.  
It was a most privileged moment for me, sometime ago, to see a male strolling across, with its held high, in a grassland. As I was watching it intently, I failed to notice the female, who sauntered across gently. Soon both of them disappeared in the vast grassland and to my great surprise and joy they mated! That moment continues to remain alive in my memory.
Sadly when I visited that habitat again, not a single GIB was there.
With less than hundred Great Indian Bustards in the country and their alarming decline over the years, it is real possibility that they may become extinct in the future. 
As we ravage their habitat
And let the grasslands dwindle
This gracious bird
Will just cease to be…
20/05/22, 6:20 pm - Nalini N R: Sorry state of affairs. Man is  in the path of self destruction🤔

22/05/22, 1:51 pm - Dr Raguram: There is profound beauty in the vast, arid landscape of The Little Rann of Kutch. Its incredible biodiversity supports an astonishing range of flora and fauna, many of them unique to the region. The International Biodiversity Day today, draws attention to the crucial role of biodiversity in maintaining a healthy ecosystem. 
An important native member of the ecosystem of the Little Rann of Kutch is the Indian wild ass. In Kutchi language, the Indian wild ass is called ghorkhar. It is the only region in India where they live in the wild, one of the main reasons being that unlike donkeys and horses, it was never successfully domesticated. Groups of them graze nonchalantly unmindful of the scorching heat amidst patches of grasslands. They are notoriously shy and quickly bolt with amazing speed, once they spot an inquisitive human observer! Seeing herds of these majestic creatures sprinting across the parched land with streaks of dust in their wake is an unforgettable sight!
22/05/22, 3:26 pm - Nalini N R: Sir, nice to know that there are some animals which are beyond human grasp!! It's better to feel happy about the existence of places maintaining the healthy ecosystem rather than cribbing about the looming annihilation.
22/05/22, 6:35 pm - Dr Raguram: The Boys' Hostel in the tribal school at Wayanad which we have been supporting for over a decade from our NGO Paadhai (paadhai.org) is in a miserable condition.

24/05/22, 8:37 am - Dr Raguram: The day began with this beautiful song, Dwaitamu Sukhama, Advaitamu Sukhama, wherein Saint Thyagaraja expresses the dilemma faced by many seekers. 
Dwaita and advaita offer two very different answers for the fundamental question of all philosophy: what is the nature of the world and that of the internal self? Dwaita claims that there are fundamentally two entities, jIvAtma and paramAtma, with the internal self being jIvAtma and the external world being a multi-faceted manifestation of paramAtma. Advaita posits that there is but only the paramAtma and the internal self is also a manifestation of the paramAtma. 
They are often positioned as two different, dissimilar paths.
An elegant, insightful perspective is provided in a verse from Ashtavakra Gita.
kva dharmaḥ kva ca vā kāmaḥ kva cārthaḥ kva vivēkatā |
kva dvaitaṃ kva ca vā(a)dvaitaṃ svamahimni sthitasya mē || 19-2 ||
For me, established in my own glory, there is no religion, 
sensuality, possessions, philosophy, duality or even non-duality.

25/05/22, 8:31 am - Dr Raguram: On this World Otter Day, I recollect my first sighting of the smooth coated otters in the backwaters of Chimmony. It was a glorious evening with the setting sun framing the backwaters with brilliant hues and as we were cruising along in a boat, suddenly I noticed a group of otters, just in front of us.  They were barking like dogs at us with khar kharr sounds. Neer-nai as they are often referred to as, might appear drab brown at a casual glance.  But these sleek little water-wanderers were graceful as they ambled along the crevices of the rocks. Some were coming out of the water with their snouts just visible, making waves of whirls in the calm water. A group of them swiftly emerged out of the crevices and were staring at us, upright! We spent a few minutes watching them before they quietly slinked away. 
These Smooth Coated Otters are closely related to the Giant Otters of South America and are Asia’s largest otters. They are highly social and are often seen in packs. They mostly feed on fish (more than 90% of their diet is fish) and that makes them quite unpopular among fishermen. However, trained smooth-coated otters are often used by fisherman to herd fish into nets. Unfortunately, their population is threatened by loss of wetland habitats, poaching, and contamination of waterways by pesticides. 
Otters
Glide amidst the rocks
Straight into my heart…

30/05/22, 9:57 am - Dr Raguram: Matsuo Basho was a 17th century Haiku master. His singularly simple, beautiful poems are sublime catalysts for a Zen like reflective state like this one.
30/05/22, 2:16 pm - Nalini N R: What a beautiful scenery Sir! And the lines of wisdom broadens our outlook.

05/06/22, 8:22 am - Dr Raguram: As we usher in another World Environment Day, it is a sad and stark fact that the health of our environment is not in good shape. A slew of factors ranging from global warming to deforestation have left their impact on an already fragile planet.
The campaign this year focuses on "Living Sustainably in Harmony with Nature." 
A little bird has been practising this quietly, for centuries…the Barn Swallow!
Barn swallows have always been linked to people, even adapting former nesting grounds in caves and cliff faces for manmade structures and living harmoniously with the humans. In many parts of the world, having Barn Swallows nesting on one's property is considered a sign of good fortune. Unfortunately, scores of them were slaughtered for their feathers in the Victorian era for decorating ladies’ hats. Concerned with this practice and the decimation of the birds, George Bird Grinnell wrote his famous editorial in ‘Forest and Stream’ in 1886 opposing it. That editorial led to the formation of the Audubon Society and the advent of the conservation movement in the United States. 
These twittery, flittery birds love to eat the insects that we consider pesky. They consume 60 insects in an hour which can even go up to 850 per day. That's how much each bird eats. Working efficiently as effective pest control agents they do their bit silently to maintain the environment.
Let this diminutive bird inspire us on this day!
As Shakespeare wrote, “True hope is swift and flies with swallow’s wings.”
05/06/22, 2:15 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. Each one of us will have to take the responsibility. But man has become so self centered being in the city unlike tribals who consider environment as their God!

08/06/22, 8:39 am - Dr Raguram: On the World Ocean Day, let us recall that life on earth probably began in hydrothermal vents in the depths of the oceans. But it was not the ocean we know today. It was warmer, more acidic and rich in iron. As life evolved, the oceans continued to provide home to many living things. In fact, a greater number of organisms live in the oceans than on land.  Covering more than 70 per cent of the earth’s surface, they are humanity’s most important natural resource. Oceans feed us, regulate our climate and generate most of the oxygen we breathe. 
Unfortunately, they also face major threats: global climate change, pollution, habitat destruction, invasive species, and a dramatic decrease in ocean fish stocks. These threats to the ocean are so extensive that more than 40 percent of the ocean has already been severely affected and no area has been left untouched. 
The World Ocean Day is a timely reminder to develop a shared vision of a sustainable use of oceans. 
As for me, the ocean with its enormity and mystery, has always been a continuing source of enchantment. There is no music more relaxing than the rolling of ocean waves.
My most memorable trip along the ocean was in California highway 1. It is perhaps one of the most astoundingly scenic roads in the world. Smelling the salty and briny sea breeze of the Pacific Ocean, seeing its vastness and feeling so small in the middle of its quiet stillness…these are emotions only the ocean can stir.
Poets capture these moments beautifully, like in these words of Meena Alexander, “Sometimes the syllables of poetry  well up, waves on the surface of the sea, and they  burst as flying fish might, struck by light.”
As TS Eliot wrote in Four Quartets, “The river is within us, the sea is all about us, ” and we have to tend to both with sensitivity and concern…

08/06/22, 2:57 pm - Nalini N R: Oh what a beauty. The photograph conveys a lot! It really soars the spirit🙂
09/06/22, 8:28 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
09/06/22, 8:28 am - Dr Raguram: Sunset has always inspired poets.
Poets of the Sangam era (300 BCE to 300 CE) were no exception. Sangam literature contains 2381 poems in Tamil composed by 473 poets, It includes Tolkappiyam, Ettuthogai, Pattuppattu, Pathinenkilkanakku, and two epics, Silappathikaram and Manimegalai.
Kalithogai is part of the eight anthologies (Ettuthogai), It contains one hundred and fifty poems which were written by various authors. This particular one was written by the poet Nallanthuvan. 
அகல் ஞாலம் விளக்கும் தன் பல் கதிர் வாய் ஆகப்
பகல் நுங்கியது போலப் படுசுடர் கல் சேர
The sun that lights the wide world 
Unfurls its many rays 
And joins the mountains 
As if it swallowed the day
There are occasions when photography and poetry can come together and this is once such moment…
09/06/22, 5:23 pm - Nalini N R: Absolutely bewitching beauty! We may not have the capability to string words to explain the feelings but definitely experience the breathtaking moment of sun set!!
12/06/22, 9:14 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
12/06/22, 9:14 am - Dr Raguram: Today is Vaikasi Visakam which is celebrated as the birthday of Lord Muruga. Worship of Lord Muruga is interwoven with folk myths, personal and cultural histories. He has an unbounded and immortal presence across Tamil Nadu, inspiring intense devotion. A god who fosters multiple narratives, each and every community, has a story about their own divine ancestry featuring Lord Muruga.
Some of the earliest sculptural depictions of young Lord Muruga is in the Somaskandamurthy panels
which can be seen in the first freestanding temple in Tamil Nadu, the Kailasanatha Temple in Kanchipuram. 
As we walk around the temple precincts, we can see many of these panels which portray Siva and Parvati with Skanda sitting on Parvati’s lap. In a larger depiction, (photgraph 1) Vishnu can also be seen in the back, in addition to Siva, Parvati and Skanda. Many of the small shrines that dot the inner wall of the courtyard have Somaskanda panels. One of them which attracted my attention was a striking portrayal with the remnants of vibrant hues adorning the back wall. Unfortunately, the face of Skanda has worn out with time. But its beauty and allure hasn’t faded…
12/06/22, 7:01 pm - Nalini N R: I didn't know about this. Wonderful sculptures and the sunlight which is falling on them and the eye catching colours is adding on the beauty.
14/06/22, 6:52 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
14/06/22, 6:52 am - Dr Raguram: Today is the birthday of WB Yeats. He wrote the poem “The White Birds” the day after Maude Gonne, “his great unrequited love,” rejected his first marriage proposal. She had expressed the feeling that she would rather be a “seagull” than any other bird. Yeats went along with this image and wrote this poem. Though never formalized by marriage vows their love did achieve literary immortality with this poem.
14/06/22, 10:43 pm - Nalini N R: If the poet has given life to his thoughts through words, you have aptly chosen the wonderful photograph Sir!
15/06/22, 9:01 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
15/06/22, 9:01 am - Dr Raguram: “I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of scenery; air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, "This is what it is to be happy.” Sylvia Plath
Sometimes I freeze those moments through my photographs.
In the words of Lord Byron, “I love not man the less, but Nature more.”
Recollecting these lines of my favourite poets on the occasion of the Nature Photography Day…
15/06/22, 12:48 pm - Nalini N R: Oh so very true. If it can be so enchanting looking at the photograph, it is heavenly to be present amidst nature.  Nothing like nature. It soothes any wound. Fantastic photograph Sir!
17/06/22, 6:57 am - Dr Raguram: Morning Nalini. Where do you consult now?
17/06/22, 7:04 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
17/06/22, 7:04 am - Dr Raguram: காக்கை சிறகினிலே நந்தலாலா
நின்றன் கரிய நிறம் தோன்றுதையே நந்தலாலா
In the black colours of the crow 
I have a glimpse you Nanda (Krishna)
These are the opening lines of “Kaakai Siraginile,” one of the most beautiful poems of Mahakavi Bharathiyar. It is a simple octet with references to a crow’s feather and a tryst with fire in the quest of Nandalala, the young Krishna. As with most poems, a direct translation doesn’t do justice to the nuances of the song itself. 
Why did the poet choose the crow? 
Crows are generally considered scavengers and generally not portrayed in good light. As someone known for raising his voice against social injustice, was Bharathiyar implying that even in such creatures, he sees the divine nature of Krishna. Was he also indicating that people can see Him everywhere in nature?
The poem embodies the eternal truth that the seeker can perceive the presence of the formless in all its forms.
17/06/22, 4:11 pm - Nalini N R: Really food for thought Sir. It is very true that we detest crows and many have superstitions about sighting a crow. What a way to accept every creation in the universe and once again reinforcing the fact that focus should be Atman and not limited to body mind. And what a photograph because we rarely come across a crow being the subject👍🏻
17/06/22, 5:43 pm - Dr Raguram: Where do you consult now?
17/06/22, 5:44 pm - Nalini N R: I go to the clinic once or twice a week Sir and have telethrapy rest of the days.
17/06/22, 5:46 pm - Dr Raguram: I had asked Kulkarni to get in touch with you in this number and he message saying that you don’t come to the clinic
17/06/22, 5:48 pm - Nalini N R: Oh yes. He did call up but I told him that I have given appointments on Saturday. I usually go on Mondays and Fridays as I see children for assessments.
17/06/22, 5:49 pm - Nalini N R: He wants to come to the clinic only.
17/06/22, 6:07 pm - Dr Raguram: What day can he come Nalini?
17/06/22, 6:15 pm - Nalini N R: I can see him only next Friday Sir.
17/06/22, 6:16 pm - Dr Raguram: Thanks Nalini!
17/06/22, 6:17 pm - Nalini N R: Welcome Sir

18/06/22, 8:29 am - Dr Raguram: Paul McCartney who is turning 80 today is a favourite singer of mine.
Shortly after returning from India where he was learning the art of Transcendental Meditation, he wrote "Blackbird" which was featured in the ‘White Album.’ I keep listening to this tranquil guitar ballad often. This song was written solely by Paul McCartney. However, he acknowledged the role of John Lennon and hence the song goes under the name Lennon-McCartney.
Paul wrote this song on the background of the civil rights movement in US. The black bird in the song refers to a group of black students who faced racial discrimination in Little Rock Central High School Arkansas. As he said later, “This was really a song from me to a black woman, experiencing these problems in the States. Let me encourage you to keep trying, to keep your faith; there is hope.’”
It is a song of empowerment, reflecting the singer’s longing for change. 
No matter how dark our circumstances may be, there is always a glimmer of hope to be found.. 
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of a dark black night
18/06/22, 1:06 pm - Nalini N R: It appears to be very much connected to Mahakavi Bharathiyar's poem. No amount of advancement in all the fields including education appears to ward off deep-rooted discrimination. Definitely requires humane attitude.
20/06/22, 7:01 pm - Nalini N R: <Media omitted>
20/06/22, 7:02 pm - Nalini N R: Thought you will like it Sir.
20/06/22, 7:09 pm - Dr Raguram: Thanks...saw it a while ago
20/06/22, 7:09 pm - Nalini N R: 😊

21/06/22, 7:46 am - Dr Raguram: Among all yoga asanas Vrksasana or tree pose is one of the most beautiful and serene one imbued with symbolic significance. It is also one of the oldest known yoga poses and is depicted in ancient sculptures.
An earliest representations is in “Bhagiratha’s Penance” or “The Descent of the Ganges” in Mahabalipuram which is dated to the 7th century. Bhagiratha stood in Vrksasana for one thousand years which persuaded Brahma and Shiva to create the Ganges.
In the first photograph one can notice a man standing on top left in the Vrksasana pose. Interestingly on the bottom right is a cat with a similar pose. Probably the cat is pretending to be a peaceful yogi fooling the mice (seen at its feet) before it eats them!
The second photo which portrays the asana in detail is from a pillar in the Thirukurungudi temple. It is slightly different from the former with one leg in Ardha Padmasana (Half-Lotus) and hands in Anjali Mudra (prayer position).
Symbolically, the tree is said to be strong and well grounded. It grows both upwards and downwards, ensuring stability. The grounding action of the standing leg represents the roots of a tree, and the stretching of the arms overhead represents the branches reaching upwards. It is believed that when one holds the pose, prana (life force) goes up facilitating the release of a transformative energy. 
Dualities vanish
If, for a moment
We become a tree…
21/06/22, 5:50 pm - Nalini N R: Such wonderful sculptures Sir. It is so difficult to chisel these postures!
22/06/22, 11:24 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
22/06/22, 11:24 am - Dr Raguram: As I was listening to the enchanting pallavi of Oothukadu Venkata Subbaier krithi, 
“kuzhaloodhi manamellaam kollaikondapinnum
kuraiyaedhum enakkaedhadi sakiyae
When he plays his flute and takes hold of my heart
Will I ever be discontented my friend? (my translation)
I remembered that yesterday was the World Music Day.
Lord Krishna is inseparable from his flute and the lure of his music is irresistible.
One of the most beautiful depiction of this is in the Chitra Gopuram of Thirukurungudi temple in Tirunelveli district.
Carved with exquisite detail, it portrays Lord Krishna holding the flute with his two hands with shanku and chakra on the other two hands. The sages, devatas, cowherds, people, animals and birds are totally entranced by the mellifluous music emanating from the flute. The snake at his feet is no exception. The sculptor animates the scene by portraying a mischievous monkey stealing butter from the cowherd!
There is a beautiful story about how Radha is jealous of the flute because it is always with the Lord. Once she asks the flute, “what is it that you have which I lack, that he is always with you?" The flute replies: "Perhaps he likes me because I am empty."
When we empty ourselves, the lord enters and fills that space.
22/06/22, 10:51 pm - Nalini N R: Wow.. Such a pleasing beautiful sculpture Sir. Blessed are the sculptors and thanks for the photograph. The very sight of it brings a smile on our face and the atmosphere so serene. And your narrative.... Too good....

25/06/22, 7:48 am - Dr Raguram: Sand dunes have an irresistible charm, especially in the desert landscape.
Several years ago we ventured onto the sand dunes of Khuri and spent the night there.
It was an unforgettable experience.
Lying down on the sand I saw nothing but a vast expanse of dark, nocturnal sky, radiant with sparkling, shimmering stars. It was a starry night straight out of Vincent van Gogh’s palette and I took his suggestion, “It often seems to me that the night is even more richly coloured than the day…if you look carefully, you’ll see that some stars are lemony, others have a pink, green, forget-me-not blue glow.”
The wind was sculpting millions of fine sand particles to form tantalizing shapes with remarkable patterns. 
Every sand particle brushing against my hands was an experience.
As Rachel Carson commented “in every grain of sand there is the story of the earth.”
I can still feel those grains of sand in the hour glass of my memory….
(On the occasion of the World Sand Dune Day!)
25/06/22, 1:27 pm - Nalini N R: Oh I didn't know even for that there is a day!! Like any other photograph of yours this is also a fantastic one Sir. The texture is so very realistically smooth though the day can be very harsh (for someone from Bengaluru)!! But that is nature, so spicy.
25/06/22, 1:27 pm - Dr Raguram: I keep discovering days😄
25/06/22, 1:29 pm - Nalini N R: 👍🏻
26/06/22, 7:36 pm - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
26/06/22, 7:36 pm - Dr Raguram: Had a surprise visitor this evening. Santosh dropped in to convey that he has secured the first rank in DM Medical Oncology in AIIMS Delhi. He did MD Gen Medicine also there. His sister has also secured a high rank in NEET and might be joining a post graduate course in AIIMS.
Theirs is a remarkable story of sheer dedication and unstinted effort to excel. Hailing from a very poor family (his father used to work as a parking attender in KIMS), they literally studied under the street lights.
Ahalya and myself played a small role in furthering their dreams all through their medical career
And continue to be inspired by these talented youngsters
26/06/22, 8:09 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. Fantastic Sir. Such an inspiration for anyone. Grit matters👌🏻
26/06/22, 8:10 pm - Dr Raguram: We feel inspired by these talented youngsters. While supporting their educational expenses all through their medical career, we were keen that both of them are kept in the dark about it. It is such an ennobling experience to be part of their journey
26/06/22, 8:27 pm - Nalini N R: Great Sir. They are so lucky In addition to their talent to have got help from God through you and Madam.
30/06/22, 9:29 am - Dr Raguram: Camera and observation have a symbiotic relationship. Through camera we have the opportunity to observe the world more closely. As I watch a bird fluttering around, the distance between us narrows down. In the midst of this immersive experience, sometimes my camera freezes the moment. Time ceases and the observer and observed become one…
Incidentally yesterday was the World Camera Day.
30/06/22, 9:29 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
30/06/22, 7:41 pm - Nalini N R: Wonderful photograph Sir. I think one needs to be swift in catching the observed moment which I see in your photographs especially in the case of birds which change their position and fly!
04/07/22, 8:21 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
04/07/22, 8:21 am - Dr Raguram: As humans we have the privilege to express ourselves through our speech. On many occasions we find that a simple gesture of the hand can express our thoughts equally well and perhaps much better. 
Specific hand gestures that symbolize and convey various meanings are referred to as Mudras. Mudra Vidhanam, written by Anna and published by Ramakrishna Mutt lists at least 137 mudras. When a sculptor creates a deity, he adds various mudras to express the idea symbolized by it.
For instance look at these images. First one is from Gangaikondacholapuram and the second from the bronze gallery from Chennai museum. You will notice the gesture of the right hand, where the forefinger is joined with the thumb and the other three fingers remain separate. This is often referred to as Chinmudra. 
The thumb represents Brahman because without the thumb the hand cannot function. The middle, ring and the small finger represents the body, mind and intellect respectively. Index finger represents the ego because it keeps pointing at others most of the times! When we hold our hand normally the index finger is attached to the other three fingers and is far away from the thumb. This indicates that we normally think of ourselves as the body, mind and intellect, separate from the Brahman. As long as we have this notion, we will have a beginning and an end. When the index finer (ego) separates itself from the body/mind/ intellect and unites with the thumb (representing the Brahman), it forms a circle, which has no beginning and end. It symbolizes the union of the jivatma with the Paramatma, which is the essence of all realisation. 
Some symbols convey the deeper meanings with sublime simplicity…
04/07/22, 1:13 pm - Nalini N R: Very enlightening Sir!!
06/07/22, 10:08 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
06/07/22, 10:08 am - Dr Raguram: Dalai Lama whose birthday is today has an enduring, deep impact on me.
When I met him several years ago, I was enveloped in his ‘being’ which emanates love and immense kindness…it seemed to flow from a profound, unending source.
His way of analyzing conflict through the lens of compassion and resilience continues to guide me in my personal and professional life.
06/07/22, 5:46 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. Really a soothing  personality and as you put it across, his face and kind expression is so contagious.
07/07/22, 9:32 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
07/07/22, 9:32 am - Dr Raguram: Forgiveness is a choice. 
In our journeys in life, invariably we might hurt ourselves or others. 
If we hold onto that pain, we end up tying rocks to our feet…too much for the wings of hope to carry. 
These words of Rumi ring so true on this Global Forgiveness Day.
A Sufi holy man was asked what forgiveness is. He said “It is the fragrance that flowers give when they are crushed”.
07/07/22, 4:30 pm - Nalini N R: Oh what a photograph and what a simile. It is only when we crush our ego that we can forgive. Wonderful Sir. Instead of waiting for the day to remind us, this should be practised constantly as it is not so easy when we don't let the hurt go. True like a rock.
08/07/22, 4:41 pm - Nalini N R: <Media omitted>
08/07/22, 4:42 pm - Nalini N R: This is a sculpture found in recent excavation in Harihareshwar temple at a place called Kundal near Sangli (Maharashtra)
Uniqueness about it is- There is only one
face of Krishna but five bodies in
different positions.
Lookat each body and you will feel
the face is of that body.
Incredible India and its rich culture!!

11/07/22, 10:05 am - Dr Raguram: Nikola Tesla, whose birthday today was a remarkable genius. He gave us alternating current, wireless radio, x-rays, radar, hydroelectric power and transistors.  Yet he is the most under-rated inventors of modern history.
Like many creative prodigies, he also experienced synaesthesia, in which stimulation of one sensory pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experience in a second sensory pathway. In Tesla’s case it was auditory to visual. When a word was spoken to me, the image of the object it designated would present itself vividly to my vision.
There were some oddities in his life, like the preoccupation with number three, amongst others.
One of the fascinating encounters he had was with Swami Vivekananda who was keen that one day “the Vedantic cosmology will be placed on the surest of scientific foundations”. Fascinated with the Vedic cosmology, Tesla began using the Sanskrit words akasha (all-pervading material of the universe) and prana (energy) to describe mass and energy in his work. However, he was unable to prove empirically a unified primal energy beyond akasha and prana. 
In his own words, “In the Universe there is a core from which we obtain knowledge, strength and inspiration. I have not penetrated into the secrets of this core, but I know that it exists.”
11/07/22, 7:49 pm - Nalini N R: Probably that is the difference between people who have superfluous knowledge and those who go into the depth of Science and Creativity. The latter sense the presence of something beyond and accept!! Thanks once again Sir for the information and  taking me beyond Elon Musk and Tesla.

12/07/22, 8:26 am - Dr Raguram: The mango season is on the wane and having savoured it, sweet memories linger on..
Absence of simplicity in life is akin to a mango without its sweetness. 
All too often, we fritter away our lives in pursuit of the tangible. Simplicity is about minimizing our needs and maximizing the meaningful aspects of life. When a mathematician tries solve a difficult problem, he first frees the equation of all impediments and reduces it to its simplest terms. Like wise to simplify our lives we need to distinguish the necessary and the real from the clutters of the material world in which we are immersed.
Many illustrious people have explored the terrain of simplicity, the most prominent of them being Henry Thoreau. He went to the Walden Pond to learn what were the “true necessaries of life”. He recorded his experiences spread over a decade in journals which were later compiled in the book Walden. 
Often Thoreau sat on the banks of the Walden Pond reading Charles Wilkin’s 1785 translation of the Bhagvat Gita. In his own words, “In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat Gita…” This particular verse from Chapter 17 draws attention to the significance of simplicity. 
मन: प्रसाद: सौम्यत्वं मौनमात्मविनिग्रह: |
भावसंशुद्धिरित्येतत्तपो मानसमुच्यते || 16||
Serenity of thought, simplicity, silence, self-control, and purity of purpose are the austerities of the mind. 
Today is also the birth anniversary of Thoreau which is celebrated as the World Simplicity Day.
It is probably a perfect day to pick up Walden and remind ourselves that pursuit of simplicity in life need not be a distant dream.
12/07/22, 6:33 pm - Nalini N R: Very true Sir. It definitely declutters our mind and helps in the pursuit of the highest. All great people of the west have links to our treasure which we have to be proud of!! And such a wonderful click of the enchanting scenery!!

13/07/22, 9:39 am - Dr Raguram: A true Guru would never tell the seeker or the student what to do. 
On the contrary, he/she would give them the knowledge with which they could decide what would be best path for them to venture. When he/she points a finger towards the path of discovery the students attention is often fixed on the finger and not the path.
Thich Nhat puts this succinctly "just as a finger pointing at the moon is not the moon itself. A thinking person makes use of the finger to see the moon. A person who only looks at the finger and mistakes it for the moon will never see the real moon."
I hail from a family of teachers and have been blessed with Gurus who inspired and guided me ‘to see the moon’ in my professional journey. This quest remains unabated as I continue to learn from my multitudinous talented students.
The letter ‘gu’ refers to darkness, the letter ‘ru’ means he who dispels such darkness, ‘Guru’ is called so because of his ability to dispel darkness of ignorance.
In Indian spiritual traditions, Dakshinamurthy is perceived as the First Guru, Adi Guru.
Iconographically, he is depicted in various forms and this beautiful carving is from Amirthagadeswarar  temple at Melakadambur which was built by the Chola King Kulothunga-I in 1113 AD
13/07/22, 10:46 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. In everyone's life there will be Gurus, but acknowledging, making use of the teachings and being grateful is something not so common.
13/07/22, 10:48 pm - Nalini N R: A fantastic carving, even the fine carving of the leg is so conspicuous.
14/07/22, 9:36 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
14/07/22, 9:36 am - Dr Raguram: Yesterday was Guru Purnima and it is not mere coincidence that it was also the day in 6th century BCE when Buddha delivered his first sermon after his enlightenment at Bodhgaya. It is recorded as the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, which means "The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma." It took place in the Deer Park at Varanasi to the group of five ascetics, namely Kondañña, Assaji, Bhaddiya, Vappa, and Mahānāma. 
In this sermon, the Buddha outlined the core conceptual framework of Buddhism. He began with the doctrine of the Middle Way, which emphasizes that the path to enlightenment lies between extremes of self-indulgence and self-denial. Then Buddha explained the Four Noble Truths, which are: Life is dukkha, dukkha is driven by craving, there is a way to be liberated from both and that way is the Eightfold Path. Eightfold Path encompasses: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. 
Dukkha is a Pali word is often translated as unhappiness, pain or suffering. Suffering is inevitable in our lives, it is part of our human condition. By learning to be still and coming face to face with our pain and disappointments we have the opportunity to transform ourselves.
An ancient tribal saying states it succinctly, “Before we can see properly we must first shed our tears to clear the way.”
14/07/22, 8:04 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. Nowadays people want to turn to spirituality as an escape. Going through the vagaries of life, facing the hardships is the only way to become strong and think beyond. Thank you for letting me revise and ponder over the teachings.
16/07/22, 9:42 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
16/07/22, 9:42 am - Dr Raguram: Much like meditation, observing nature is an act of mindfulness. In the process, a deep connection emerges which is infinitely soothing. 
It was early morning and we were the first few in the hallowed precincts of Muir Woods. As I was watching the sun streaming through the leafy branches of trees, I was reminded of the words of John Muir “between every two pine trees there is a door leading to a new way of life.” Yet at the same time it was a reminder as to how fragile our world has become. I was wondering whether there is a term that encapsulates this experience and I stumbled upon this word Ambedo.
“Ambedo is a kind of melancholic trance in which you become completely observed in vivid sensory details, briefly soaking in the experience of being alive, an act that is done purely for its own sake.”
16/07/22, 7:04 pm - Nalini N R: It is alarming to see the present day life style. We are distancing more and more from nature and going against our natural selves. What is going to happen to the posterity? But looking at the photograph offers momentary tranquility.

18/07/22, 8:17 am - Dr Raguram: The World Listening Day on 18th of July is a reminder for us to take time and listen to the sounds of nature. It honours the birthday of Canadian environmentalist Murray Schafer one of the pioneers of the Acoustic Ecology movement. The theme this year is Listening Across Boundaries.
We are incessantly immersed in sounds of nature…whether it is the rustling of the leaves in the wind, the pitter patter of rain drops on the window pane or the natural orchestra of bird calls in the morning.
As our environment changes so too the sounds. Engrossed in the random cacophony of urban living, sitting at our computers or checking our mobiles, we are inattentive to the other sounds surrounding us. 
The sounds of nature have long inspired artists be it in the realms of poetry or music. Beethoven found inspiration in nature. He loved to take walks in the countryside and take notes on the natural world he observed. The first movement of the Pastoral Symphony, ‘Awakening of cheerful feelings on arrival in the countryside,’ immediately evokes a sense of relaxation.  It's about seeing nature as a source of harmony. The second movement, ‘Scene by the brook’ evokes sounds of cuckoos and nightingales. In the third movement we hear the ‘Merry gathering of the country folk’ and the next movement heralds the onset of the storm. As the storm slowly dies down, there is the cow waltz in the last movement. Interestingly cow waltz is still played on the alphorn in Switzerland to encourage cows to produce more milk! It is not surprising then that the Pastoral Symphony was played performed at the United Nations World Environment Day as a “global statement for the preservation of nature”.
The health benefits of exposure to sounds of nature has been extensively documented. For instance, Stephen and Rachel Kaplan spent twenty years exploring the impact of natural sounds and in their Attention Restoration Theory, or ART, proposed that this can help us improve our focus and ability to concentrate. 
Listening is a way of being in the world and feeling the vibrations of nature opens up an entirely new world of enriching experiences.
Next time you take a walk, listen deeply and immerse yourself in the serenity of the sonic landscape of nature. You might hear the melodic chirping of a lone bird sitting on a tree branch.
As the Chinese proverb states, “Keep a green tree in your heart and perhaps a singing bird will come”.   
Listen
To the sounds of nature
The whispers of the wind
Waves lapping the shores
Chatter of the sparrows
Flutter of the birds
And the silence in between…
18/07/22, 6:26 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. No point in cribbing about the crazy urban cacophony but try to filter out unwanted and focus on the sounds of nature. Depends on the mindset, automatically we are drawn to the sounds!

19/07/22, 10:36 am - Dr Raguram: Hunter Thompson whose birthday is today was a hugely talented maverick. 
He developed a style of journalism which is often referred to as gonzo journalism. It is a type of journalism where the writer becomes part of the story, portraying events through their own experience. His ‘Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream’ is a compelling read. 
He led a troubled life, often experiencing periods of low mood, articulating it in these poignant words…
19/07/22, 1:32 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. What a way to ventilate! Thank you Sir for introducing us to such people and their work.
22/07/22, 8:12 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
22/07/22, 8:12 am - Dr Raguram: Our brain is a mysterious jungle and there have been many remarkable people who have ventured into its enigmatic trails, providing us with valuable insights.
On the World Brain Day, let us remember Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the father of neuroscience who was also an aspiring artist. Armed with a rudimentary microscope which he bought with his savings, he set out to disentangle and catalogue the brain’s neuronal wildlife. He drew what he saw through the lens with delicate precision, offering tantalizing glimpses about the inner workings of the nervous system. His efforts were rewarded with the Nobel Prize along with Camillo Golgi. Where Golgi only saw an impenetrable jungle, Cajal was able to parse each tree with detail. 
An interesting research revealed that Nobel Laureates were more likely to have arts and crafts hobbies than Royal Society and National Academy members. It may be that such activities offer endless opportunities for creative explorations both inside and outside the scientific realm. His work has often been compared to that of Andreas Vesalius, the Renaissance physician whose exquisite drawings of his own anatomical dissections revolutionized medicine. Cajal’s immense artistic skills similarly led him to profound insights into brain development and function, most of which have stood the test of time.
Cajal was also a prolific writer and wrote more than 200 books including science fiction!
His advice to young researchers was simple, “Any man could, if he were so inclined, be the sculptor of his own brain.”
22/07/22, 1:41 pm - Nalini N R: Thank you Sir for the glimpse into great researchers' works. Artistic bent of mind is a precursor for any kind of exploration into the unknown.
25/07/22, 9:09 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
25/07/22, 9:09 am - Dr Raguram: The landscape of Corbett is quite magical. One can spend hours amidst the vast grasslands, gently undulating hills, marshy depressions and riverine belts. It is the oldest national park in the country and is named after Jim Corbett whose birthday is today.
Corbett was a hunter with a heart. He tracked and killed 19 tigers and 14 leopards which were responsible for slaying around 1,200 people, without suffering even a scratch! He would mostly work alone, venturing into the jungles with his faithful dog Robin by his side. He also wrote six books which offer fascinating accounts of his trysts with the wildlife. His ‘Man eating leopard of Rudraprayag’ is exciting narrative of a leopard that spread terror killing more than hundred people. Apart from being an account of the relentless pursuit of animal for more than a year, it also offers rich insights into lives in the Garhwal region. It is an ode to the people who inhabit the terrain and the resilience with which they face the hardships that assail them. On the highway to the town,  there is a tree by the side of the road where one can find a notice which reads: “This was the tree on which Jim Corbett sat and shot dead the Man Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag in 1926.”
Corbett died on April 19, 1955, days after finishing his sixth book, Tree Tops. A year later, the state of Uttarakhand renamed the national park he helped found as Jim Corbett National Park. In addition to the national park that bears his name, there’s a species of endangered Indochinese tiger, Panthera tigris corbetti, that bears his name.
In spite of his prowess as a hunter, Corbett was a naturalist at heart and voiced the need for wildlife conservation in India long before it became a popular refrain. 
A child of the Kumaon region, its forests inspired his lifelong effort to protect animals and people alike.
In his own words, “The book of nature has no beginning, as it has no end. Open this book where you will, and at any period of your life, and if you have the desire to acquire knowledge you will find it of intense interest, and no matter how long or how intently you study the pages, your interest will not flag, for in nature there is no finality.”
25/07/22, 8:51 pm - Nalini N R: So nice to read through but with a heavy heart as I feel we have come so far away from nature. Man is encroaching the natural habitat and believes he can thrive without wildlife and forests. In for trouble 😒 Thanks Sir for the info.
27/07/22, 7:49 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
27/07/22, 7:49 am - Dr Raguram: Rajendra Chola I, one of the greatest rulers of Tamil Chola dynasty of India was born in the Tamil month of Aadi on Tiruvadirai day, which was yesterday. During his reign, he extended the influence of the already vast Chola empire up to the banks of the river Ganges in the north and across the ocean. He brought the waters of the Ganges to anoint his new capital and acquired the title ‘Gangaikonda Cholan’ (he who brought the Ganges). His navy was unmatched and sailed to kingdoms that are now Malaysia, Maldives, Indonesia and Cambodia. Through his naval victories he controlled the maritime trade in the Indian Ocean. During the course of his reign, he defeated Mahipala, the Pala king of Bengal and Bihar, and to commemorate his victory, built a new capital called Gangaikonda Cholapuram. It was to be the capital for about 250 years. Here, Rajendra built a majestic temple Gangaikonda Choleeswaram. It is a glorious representation of Chola architecture and is a rich repository of some of the most exquisite sculptures one can ever set eyes upon. 
For instance, as one ascends a long flight of steps leading to the sanctum, on the right side, carved in a large niche is a beautifully carved sculpture of Siva, Parvathi and Chandesa.  Siva is adorned with intricate jewels with his immense locks of hair resembling a crest. To his left is Parvathi, with a jewelled crown. Both have one leg folded up. Below them is the devotee Chandesa. Siva is in the process of winding a garland of flowers around Chandesa's head who, with folded hands accepts the honour. A striking feature of this panel is that the three main figures face different directions. As you walk up the stairs you realise that Chandesa is looking at you. Some scholars and historians have suggested that it could be Rajendra Chola himself who is represented here as Chandesa, sitting at the feet of Siva. 
Rajendra Chola was not merely a fearsome warrior but also a connoisseur of arts, as can be seen in this gorgeous panel and the outstanding architecture of the temple. 
Unfortunately, the legacy of Rajendra Chola remains buried in the annals of Indian history. It is only in the past few years that his legendary contributions have begun to receive the attention which they richly deserve. In honour of this pioneer maritime king, a portrait of Rajendra Chola was installed in the Mazgoan docks in 2016 and a training ship, TS Rajendra, has also been named after him.
27/07/22, 10:13 pm - Nalini N R: Such life like sculptures, what magic was there in their fingers! Thanks Sir for taking us into the past, for a change not the negative but something to cherish.
29/07/22, 7:51 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
29/07/22, 7:51 am - Dr Raguram: There is always a surprise element in spotting a tiger.
One early morning, we were tumbling along the dust tracks in Corbett. On hearing the alarm calls of the langurs the vehicles in front of us speeded ahead. Our driver avoided the rush and took a side road. 
A brown fish owl caught my attention and when I turned my gaze away from it, there it was, sauntering nearby, ignoring our presence. The tiger sat on the ground, with the dappled sunlight on its golden coat. Slowly it lifted its head, growled, got up and bolted into the thicket. I was in a daze. Those few minutes are etched in my memory forever. 
Over the years during all our visits in the jungle, invariably we had a glimpse of the Lord of the Jungle.
The last one was at Panna. We were at Sarai at Torria and had the privilege of spending time with our host Raghu Chundawat. Raghu has been documenting and researching the lives of the big cats in Panna for decades. In 2009, the national park made headlines when it lost every single tiger due to poaching. Raghu raised the alarm, compiled a report titled “Missing tigers of Panna” and sent it to the Ministry of Environment & Forests. He had to pay a heavy price for drawing attention to the sordid state of affairs at Panna. His research permits were cancelled and he was denied entry to the Park, even as a tourist. He was accused of running a ‘hidden agenda’ by the head of Project Tiger and was probed about his possible role in poaching! The intimidation and harassment continued till a Special Investigation Team set up by the National Tiger Conservation Authority confirmed that there are no tigers left in Panna. A scientist who should have recognized for daring to speak up for the tigers of Panna found himself being systematically intimidated and harassed. Unfortunately, this is the bane of tiger conservation efforts in the country which is to a large extent bureaucratized. 
Just as the tiger returns to Panna, the reserve itself is up against a new threat: Ken-Betwa river-linking project. If implemented, it will submerge prime forest spread over 4,000 hectares and destroy 11 lakh trees. Moreover, the tiger reserve itself will be bifurcated, leaving even less forest space for the beleaguered tigers.
It was our privilege to receive the autographed copy of Raghu’s book, ‘The Rise and Fall of the Emerald Tigers’ which is based on his decade-long research in Panna National Park. It covers a vast canvas highlighting the importance of investigating and understanding the ecological needs of tigers and also drawing attention to the dark side of conservation practices in the country.
Redolent with these memories, we made our way back from Panna, fervently hoping for a larger vision about conservation of tigers which is sensitive to inspiring efforts by committed individuals and informed by research inputs.
29/07/22, 1:37 pm - Nalini N R: Man is unfortunately against himself. Greed and corruption are making us lower than animals.
30/07/22, 9:20 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
30/07/22, 4:50 pm - Nalini N R: It's so ironical. Flowers brought a smile immediately but the words on the contrary. To be at the heights of creativity or achievement one has to pay the price in terms of eccentricity🤔

01/08/22, 5:39 am - Dr Raguram: Moby Dick is a multi-layered novel in which Herman Melville (whose birthday is today) handles several themes. One salient refrain is the story of man's attempt to defeat nature. Nature itself is personified through the white whale, one of the sea’s greatest marvels. They are a part of nature themselves. Any act of violence against them becomes an act of violence against nature as well. If nature is a thing of wonder that should be treated with great respect, its creatures should be treated in the same manner. 
Finally, the sea takes down the men aboard the ship and the elusive Moby Dick slips away.  Nature continues to carry on as it has for the past several thousand years, regardless of those who attempt to control or destroy it and the final sentence of the novel resonates with this message: “Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.” 
William Turner was a sublime artist of the sea and painted a series of seascapes. Herman Melville was fascinated by his paintings. It is said that shortly before writing his maritime masterpiece, he travelled to England and saw some of Turner’s paintings. Aspects of Moby Dick are strikingly evocative of Turner’s style.
01/08/22, 12:56 pm - Nalini N R: We have been destroying nature like nobody's business and reaping now. Thanks once again Sir for the write up.
02/08/22, 11:04 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
02/08/22, 11:04 am - Dr Raguram: It was Aadi pooram yesterday which is considered to be the birthday of Andal. She is one of the most extraordinary personalities in religious history and is the only female among the 12 Alvars. Alvars were poet-saints of South India who expressed their devotion to Lord Vishnu in their songs resplendent with longing and bhakti.
Andal’s Nachiyar Thirmozhi matches and even surpasses Sangam love poetry.
For instance she writes….
மழையே மழையே மண் புறம் பூசி உள்ளாய் நின்று
மெழுகு ஊற்றினாற் போல் ஊற்று நல் வேங்கடத்து உள் நின்ற
அழகப்பிரானார் தம்மை என் நெஞ்சத்து அகப்படத்
தழுவ நின்று என்னைத் ததைத்துக்கொண்டு ஊற்றவும் வல்லையே?
Rain, pouring rain
My dazzling lord
Lives encased in clay
Molten wax within.
Can you rain down
And wash away the clay?
To melt my heart
With his radiant embrace
(A rather ‘amateurish’ translation of the original!)
In Nachiyar Thirumozhi, Andal writes about her dream of holding the hands of Lord Vishnu under a pearl studded canopy. In this painting, musician S Rajam who was also painter extraordinary, has depicted the scene vividly with vibrant hues.

03/08/22, 8:43 am - Dr Raguram: Once James Baldwin (whose birthday was yesterday) wrote “You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read.” 
Reading his book, The Fire Next Time, which was published more than five decades ago, widens our gaze and perspective about the dreadful legacy of racism. It is an intensely personal, passionate document. 
He writes, "The White man's unadmitted - and apparently to him, unspeakable - private fears and longings are projected onto the Negro. The only way he can be released from the Negro's tyrannical power over him is to consent, in effect, to become black himself, to become part of the suffering and dancing country that he now watches wistfully from the heights of his lonely power and, armed with spiritual traveller's cheques, visits surreptitiously after dark…..try to remember that what they believe, as well as what they do and cause you to endure, does not testify to your inferiority but to their inhumanity and fear. " It is an insightful comment about understanding the lives and tribulations of the marginalized ‘other’, who continue to face discrimination and oppression across various structural inequalities. 
Words that are as relevant today as he wrote them more than fifty years ago. 
That said, I often wonder why it is so difficult for us to recognize inhumanity and the pain of the ‘other’. Perhaps as James Baldwin reflects, “I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.”
03/08/22, 1:00 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. We celebrate Thiruvadippooram on that day and Andal Thiruppavai is sung during the month of Marghazi masam. Thanks for sharing the beautiful painting.
03/08/22, 1:05 pm - Nalini N R: Just reading his words gives rise to emotions unbearable. And the interpretation of hatred something to dwell upon.
04/08/22, 8:41 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
04/08/22, 8:41 am - Dr Raguram: Shelley whose birthday is today was not merely a talented poet. He was much ahead of the time in championing the cause of vegan diet for a sound mind and healthy body. He was also the man who first propounded the idea of massive, non-violent protest as the most appropriate and effective response to authoritarian oppression. 
In his short life, he wrote some of the most dazzling lyrical poems. I am particularly fond of the poem, “To a Skylark”. One day while walking in Italian countryside with his wife Mary, Shelley heard the melodious notes of the skylark. In the poem consisting of 24 stanzas, he describes the grace and beauty of the skylark's birdsong. He addresses the bird directly and praises the purity of its music, which is later contrasted with sad, hollow human communication. It is quintessentially an ode to the unmatched splendours of the natural world. Interestingly, Shelley uses the phrase "harmonious madness" referring to the beauty of the song of the skylark. He asks the bird to teach him “half the gladness / That thy brain must know,” for then he would overflow with “harmonious madness,” and his song would be so beautiful that the world would listen to him, even as he is now listening to the skylark.
This photograph is of a graceful Rufous Tailed Lark with a stanza from the poem.
04/08/22, 5:11 pm - Nalini N R: What a wonderful photograph Sir. The details on the wings are also visible in the sunlight. And the poet. So beautifully the poet is able to communicate what he feels and thinks. No wonder terms it as hollow communication. Great thinker's thought process and communication is so unique but so valuable.

06/08/22, 11:14 am - Dr Raguram: Flowers have a habit of blooming in the most unexpected of places…which we may not even notice.
Sometimes a poet pauses, observes and reflects on it as Alfred Tennyson (whose birthday falls today) does in his poem ‘Flower In A Crannied Wall.’
It is a short six line poem in which he muses on the connection between man, god and the cosmos. He visualizes man as flower, god as the root of the flower and the wall as cosmos. He wonders whether by plucking the flower from the wall, one can fathom its roots and understand all of its deep connections. 
The poet suggests that even the tiniest creations of the universe, those that could be found anywhere, are part of the whole of creation. Through honing the ability to understand every aspect of it, one can unravel the mystery of our connection to the divine and the cosmos.
Essentially anything , any object, no matter however mundane it may be, when truly and mindfully experienced, opens up a doorway to enlightenment.
06/08/22, 7:12 pm - Nalini N R: Wonderful photograph Sir. Their deep focus, perception and going beyond the mundane, ability to pen in it so concisely, I think is universal when it comes to poets!
07/08/22, 9:09 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
07/08/22, 9:09 am - Dr Raguram: Yesterday I had posted about Tennyson’s quest to ‘understand’ the connection between man, god and the cosmos through plucking a flower in the roadside and exploring its roots.
Can one experience that connectivity merely by ‘looking’ at a flower?
Basho who is revered as the greatest of Japan’s haiku poets observes a nazuna flower (sheperd’s purse) blooming by the wayside on a hedge and writes:
When I look carefully
I see the nazuna blooming
By the hedge!
He is content merely to "look" to sense the deep mystery of the flower. Immersing oneself through contemplative observation of an ordinary flower and pondering over its beauty, one could unravel the mystery of creation. In the process, the distinction between ourselves and nature breaks down. We become one with the universe and a reassuring sense of harmony and connection with the world permeates our consciousness. A state often referred to Eutierria.  
British naturalist and environmental writer Michael McCarthy wrote eloquently about such experiences, “There can be occasions when we suddenly and involuntarily find ourselves loving the natural world with a startling intensity, in a burst of emotion which we may not fully understand, and the only word that seems to me to be appropriate for this feeling is Joy.”
Let us reclaim and discover our joyous belonging to the natural world . . .
08/08/22, 7:20 am - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. But man has created an artificial, pseodo lack of time and money after which he is chasing. Where is the patience to stop and look and listen. They think it is not their business to do and hence there is collective destruction of nature.
08/08/22, 10:55 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
08/08/22, 10:55 am - Dr Raguram: Ardez is a small, quaint village located on the southern slope of the Silvretta alps, in the midst of lush meadows. It is an outstandingly well preserved village with typical Engadine houses. These houses have massive walls with deep set windows and archways. What makes them unique are their playfully decorated facades. These are referred to as Sgraffiti, which is derived from the Italian “sgraffiare” (to scratch). Beautiful patterns, drawings are engraved on the walls and many of them are exquisitely painted too. We spent several hours savouring each nook and corner of this charming village.
And on a corner of an old house was this cat staring straight at us. 
Cats have provided the inspiration for an incredible range of fiction, memoir and poetry. TS Elitot for examples, was a ‘cat man’. He owned many during his life and gave them various funny and outlandish names. He wrote ‘Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats’ which outsold his magnum opus ‘The Waste Land’! This excerpt is from the poem "The Naming of Cats" from the book. 
When you notice a cat in profound meditation,
The reason, I tell you, is always the same:
His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation
(Incidentally today is International Cat Day!)
08/08/22, 1:25 pm - Nalini N R: Yes many a times to catch a rat? This reminds me of a kitten brought by my father when I was young and I had to carry of course unknowingly from my grandma's place to mine. 
Thought it was a bulb and carried carefully to open it in the kitchen and to my mother's horror it was a kitten. It was a day old and we named it Deepali. She became one in the family understood tamil very well and the attachment was beyond human. Died after eating poisoned rat dragged herself to my brother's feet whom she adored. Sorry Sir for the long message but apt day to recall!

09/08/22, 12:47 pm - Dr Raguram: Libraries open up windows to the world and inspire us to explore. As Saul Bellow commented, ‘people can lose their lives in libraries’. On this National Book Lovers Day, let us remember a poet who spent his entire life as a librarian, Philip Larkin. On the occasion of the centenary of his birth today, let me share one of his poems, ‘The Trees’. 
The trees are coming into leaf
Like something almost being said;
The recent buds relax and spread,
Their greenness is a kind of grief.

Is it that they are born again
And we grow old? No, they die too.
Their yearly trick of looking new
Is written down in rings of grain.

Yet still the unresting castles thresh
In full grown thickness every May.
Last year is dead, they seem to say,
Begin afresh, afresh, afresh.
The poem consists of three stanzas with four lines each and highlights the natural cycle of nature and the cycle of life. It is about life, end of life and renewal. We grow old, but the trees have mastered the trick of looking new each year, marking the cycle of each year with a ring…
09/08/22, 11:09 pm - Nalini N R: A beautiful photograph Sir and the poem! When we connect with nature and contemplate we can understand about life and inculcate its natural ways.

10/08/22, 1:39 pm - Dr Raguram: World Lion Day, which is today is to create awareness about one of the most majestic species to walk the earth and celebrate the animal kingdom's most beautiful and fearsome creature.
Lions have been an important symbol in various kingdoms for thousands of years and appear as a theme in all cultures across the world. As the “King of the beasts," it is a symbol of majesty, strength, courage, justice, and confidence. 
Artists have been depicting lions for millennia and the list of lions in art is endless. 
In temple architecture in India, lions figure all through history and prominently during the regime of the Pallavas.
The structural temples of the Pallavas belong to two groups: Rajasimha group (A.D. 690-c.800) and the Nandivarman group (800-c.900 A.D.). The famous ‘Kailasanatha Temple’, considered as the largest sandstone temple in the world, is the best representation of the Rajasimha group of temples, while the ‘Vaikuntha Perumal Temple’ is an example of the Nandivarman group. Lion motifs started appearing under Rajasimha, marking the beginning of a pillar design in Kailasanatha temple and it reached the zenith in the Vaikuntha Perumal Temple in Kanchipuram. This temple is a masterpiece of Pallava architecture. Most impressive and unique feature of the temple are the pillars. Each one of them has a meticulously carved lion on it. They support the enclosed passage inside the temple which have a wealth of weathered but extremely detailed wall panels. 
Lions have particularly caught the public attention of late, thanks to their representation over the new parliament building. The lion represents the Buddha, formerly Shakyamuni, a member of the Shakya (lion) clan. With their mouths open, the lions seem to convey the message of dharma and the Four Noble Truths.
A timely reminder in these times…

12/08/22, 8:01 am - Dr Raguram: Elephants played a crucial role in military, political and cultural history of India.
On this World Elephant Day, let us recall their role in warfare.
The Mahabharata mentions the use of elephants in battle, though chariots were the preferred vehicle of the elite warriors. Almost every ruler in India had an army of elephants and used them effectively in battles. There are vivid descriptions of their role in the battle field. Arthashastra of Kautilya provides plenty of information on elephants, their training and conduct in wars. 
With heavy armour to protect them, elephants were trained to trample the enemy and stab soldiers with their tusks which were armed with special blades, called elephant swords. Sometimes these elephant swords were coated with poison to make them even deadlier. During a charge, elephants would slash to pieces whomever they came in contact with. In some instances, the war elephants had an iron chain with an iron ball at the end attached to their trunk to kill enemy soldiers. 
At one sweep elephants could get rid of enemy foot soldiers, scare away horses, and trample chariots. There was also the practice of intoxicating elephants as inebriated elephants could cause much more panic and break enemy formations with ease.  The Chalukyas of Vatapi were well known for their use of drunken elephants to wreak destruction on the enemy troops. Only males, especially if they were sixty years old were used in the battle. The armies didn’t raise war elephants, they hunted them in the wild, tamed and trained them.
Innovative methods were employed to scare the elephants in the battle. It was found out that the elephants were afraid of the high-pitched squealing of the pigs. To make sure that they squealed louder, they were coated with tar, resin, or oil, set on fire and despatched towards the enemy elephants!
With the advent of artillery and muskets on a larger scale, the use of war elephants decreased over time. However, they continued to be used to carry the royalty and commanders into battle.
This mural in Thiruppudaimaruthur portrays war elephants in the  'Tamirabarani battle' which took place in 1532 at Aralvaimozhi Pass, near Thovalai in Kanyakumari district between the King of Travancore, Bhoothala Veera Udaya Marthanda Varma and Emperor of Vijayanagara,  Achyutadeva Raya.

16/08/22, 1:32 pm - Dr Raguram: As we celebrated 75 years of India’s independence yesterday, another exceptional event escaped our attention. It was also the 150th birth anniversary of Sri Aurobindo, the revolutionary turned mystic. 
The decisive moment in his life was when he was incarcerated in the Alipore bomb case. Spending a year in solitary confinement, he experienced a series of spiritual awakenings. Deeply influenced by these, his life’s trajectory changed. On the strength of an 'Adesh' (Divine command) from above, he moved to Pondicherry. In his words, “Pondicherry is my place of retreat, my cave of tapasya”. Yoga that strived for personal salvation was not for him. He sought the unity with the outer along with the exploration of the inner through his ‘integral yoga’
The core of Sri Aurobindo’s political philosophy is that the state exists for the individual and not the individual for the state. He commented, “The government is for the people. It must provide for stability as well as progress. Stability may be achieved by unity and co-operative action, and progress by free individual growth. The government should be run by people who are selfless, unegoistic, scrupulously honest and capable. Their allegiance should be to the whole country; they should serve the interests of the whole country and not of any party. 
A timely reminder!
16/08/22, 9:40 pm - Nalini N R: But is it not an ideal ''State' Sir? It's absolutely scary the way things are happening. There has to be another revolution in all the fields and crush selfishness and corruption!

17/08/22, 9:00 am - Dr Raguram: Today is the birthday of Ted Hughes who was the Poet Laureate of England. 
Ted Hughes has been fascinated with the forces of nature, the world of animals and wrote number of poems exploring them. 
Notable among them is the ‘The Hawk Roosting’. It is a powerful poem about a bird of prey as it sits overlooking its domain. The poem gives voice to a natural predator as it meditates on its innate nature, waiting fiercely for his prey.
I sit in the top of the wood, my eyes closed.
Inaction, no falsifying dream
Between my hooked head and hooked feet:
Or in sleep rehearse perfect kills and eat.

The convenience of the high trees!
The air's buoyancy and the sun's ray
Are of advantage to me;
And the earth's face upward for my inspection.

My feet are locked upon the rough bark.
It took the whole of Creation
To produce my foot, my each feather:
Now I hold Creation in my foot

Or fly up, and revolve it all slowly -
I kill where I please because it is all mine.
There is no sophistry in my body:
My manners are tearing off heads -

The allotment of death.
For the one path of my flight is direct
Through the bones of the living.
No arguments assert my right:

The sun is behind me.
Nothing has changed since I began.
My eye has permitted no change.
17/08/22, 10:42 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. Thanks Sir for the fantastic photograph and the poem by the great poet. The meaning is so deep, penetrates into our fragile existence.
18/08/22, 8:23 am - Dr Raguram: Happy to inform you that the repairs in the boys hostel have been completed in spite of torrential rains in the area.

19/08/22, 9:27 am - Dr Raguram: The Krishna Janmashtami marks the birth of Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna was the eighth incarnation of Lord Vishnu and was born as the eighth son of Vasudev and Yashoda on the on the eighth (ashtami) day in the month of Bhadrapada. The Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana have lengthy descriptions of the story of his birth.
The life of Lord Krishna has been a source of perennial inspiration to the poets and the artists in India and he is portrayed in numerous paintings and sculptures in many parts of the country. Depictions of Lord Krishna vary greatly across time period, region as well as styles.
One of the most outstanding sculptural  representation of events from Lord Krishna’s life can be seen in the Amruteshwara temple at Amruthapura in Karnataka. It is one of the oldest known Hoysala temple and is an outstanding representative of Hoysala architecture. Ruvari Mallitamma, the great architect of the Hoysala dynasty, is said to have started his career as a sculptor here. It is a small temple and the exterior wall of the mantapa has panel sculptures depicting scenes from Hindu epics and legends. If one walks in a clockwise direction, he can notice twenty-five small panels portraying various events in the life of Lord Krishna in meticulous detail. This one depicts baby Krishna being placed in a cradle. 
Sri Tallapaka Annamacharya composed a lovely song Uyyala Balunuchedaru, describing gopikas placing the baby Krishna in the cradle.
19/08/22, 4:46 pm - Nalini N R: Today we are celebrating Krishna Janmashtami, son of Vasudeva and Devaki. A day when I reread Bhagavatha. The sculpture is so beautiful despite the weathered features of faces, depicting the celebration of Krishna Jayanthi which is tomorrow. 🙏🏻

20/08/22, 7:21 am - Dr Raguram: It was the World Photography Day yesterday…
For me photography is an exploration as I immerse myself in observing the world around me, be it birds, landscapes, exquisite sculptures or even rain drops on a single leaf.
As I discover the world around me, I discover myself…
20/08/22, 11:17 am - Nalini N R: Wonderful photograph Sir. But your words enhances its beauty. Very true. Surrounding nature should help us understand our own selves!
21/08/22, 10:14 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
21/08/22, 10:14 am - Dr Raguram: Today is the Poet’s Day. It is about embracing poetry and savoring it.
On this day, let me share a short poem by Ms Srilata. Her writings and poems have received many awards and accolades. This is a poem titled The Bright Blue Bird
The Bright Blue Bird
A bright blue bird
From a distant tree
Flies into my house
When it flies out
It leaves behind
Its bright blue
The blue hops down
becomes first one word,
and then, another,
till finally, it assumes the face of a poem
Before long, the floor is an upside down blue sky
and the blue of the poem has made its way
into my ink filler,
into my notebook.
21/08/22, 7:32 pm - Nalini N R: Very nice Sir. A wonderful way to pen a simple observation but what an imagination👌🏻
30/08/22, 5:35 am - Dr Raguram: Among all the gods in the Hindu pantheon, Lord Ganesha is truly an exception. His iconographic representations span a large oeuvre. He ca be portrayed sitting, standing, dancing, with astounding variations. However, amidst the varied representations, his depiction with an elephant head and human body has remained consistent. Elephant head symbolises Jnana Shakti (knowledge, wisdom) and the human body is an icon of Kriya Shakti (creative energy in action). 
Lord Ganesha urges us to make optimal use of these qualities in our everyday lives.
This sculpture of a joyous Ganesha is from a small corner of the gopuram at Arulmighu Azhagianambi Rayar Thirukovil at Thirukurungudi.

01/09/22, 7:12 am - Dr Raguram: The way to truth lies through the destruction of the false. 
To destroy the false, 
you must question your most inveterate beliefs. Of these the idea that you are the body is the worst.
With the body comes the world, 
with the world 
-- God, 
who is supposed to have created the world and thus it starts -- 
fears, religions, prayers, sacrifices, all sorts of systems -- 
all to protect and support the child-man, frightened out of his wits by monsters of his own making.
Realize that what you are cannot be born nor die, and with the fear gone, 
all suffering ends.
- Sri Nisaraghatta Maharaj.
01/09/22, 10:14 pm - Nalini N R: In the present scenario this is very apt Sir. It is so sickening and we are going in the opposite direction with all this nonsensical fanaticism.
02/09/22, 8:04 am - Dr Raguram: “When one loses the deep intimate relationship with nature, then temples, mosques and churches become important.” J Krishnamurti

04/09/22, 7:31 am - Dr Raguram: Krishna Janmashtami is closely followed two weeks later by the birthday of Radha, which is celebrated today.
The inseparable love and affection between Radha and Krishna is symbolic of the eternal striving of a devout mortal for the Divine.
“Atma To Radhika Tasya”: She is the soul and energy that resides in Krishna.
The love between Radha and Krishna has been immortalised by poets, musicians, painters and writers.
Jayadeva’s Gita Govinda is an important text that describes their relationship in exquisite detail.
For instance in act seven song fourteen verse 17, he narrates the feeling of Radha when Krishna casts a glance on her:
dayita-vilokita-lajjita-hasitä
bahu-vidha-küjita-rati-rasa-rasitä
käpi madhuripuëä
“The glance of her beloved incites a bashful laughter in her, Tasting the ambrosia of love, she murmurs like a cuckoo, voicing her pleasure with a sudden surge of ecstatic euphoria”.
 Very many schools of painting have rendered such scenes with stylistic variations. 
Thousand of Radhakrishna paintings adorn galleries and museums across the world.
Each one of them is sheer visual poetry.
This particular mural is from the Ram Gopal Poddar Chhatri in Ramgarh in the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan.

06/09/22, 6:52 am - Dr Raguram: Today is the birthday of Roger Waters. His iconic song ‘Another Brick In The Wall’  is an incisive view on formal education and a protest against authority. The bricks are people, or events, which turns us inward, away from others and reality. It essentially draws attention to the process of thought control when concepts and ideas are imprinted on our minds through totalitarian means. Timeless…

07/09/22, 12:34 am - Dr Raguram: There are times in one’s life when the desire to know the essence of thing has an irresistible appeal. ‘Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance’ fulfilled that need early in my life. It was the personal quest of the author, Pirsig in throes of intense suffering (he had 28 ECTs), to explore that realm through weaving together eastern and western philosophical thoughts in a fascinating manner. The motorcycle is a symbol of a soul in search. Reading the book is a transformational experience.
6th September was Pirsig’s birthday
07/09/22, 3:02 pm - Nalini N R: Thank you Sir for the information. Will read the book. And no words to praise the virtual journey to the spot👆🏻
09/09/22, 7:20 am - Dr Raguram: Queen Elizabeth II died “peacefully” at her home at Balmoral Castle yesterday. Human mortality is a poignant moment. 
Tolstoy took up the challenge of exploring it in his novella ‘The Death Of Ivan Ilyich”. 
It is a lyrical account of a man in the throes of impending death. Tolstoy narrates the fear, the denial, the pain, the pity, and the inevitability of death with much sensitivity. Ivan Ilyich finally looks death in the eye and that direct confrontation destroys the terrible fear which had tormented him all along. 
“Where was death? What death? There was no fear, because there was no death. 
Instead of death there was light.
“So that’s it!” he suddenly said aloud. “Such joy!”
‘The Death Of Ivan Ilyich’ is one of the most profound meditative works of literature ever written about the end of life.
The story of Ivan Ilyich is deeply relevant for insightful palliative care.
Incidentally today is Tolstoy’s birthday
09/09/22, 7:20 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>

11/09/22, 8:45 pm - Dr Raguram: Today is the death anniversary of one of the greatest Tamil poets, Mahakavi Bharathiyar.
The first All India Writers Conference took place in Madras in the 1960s. My mother was a key member of the organizing committee. As a young boy I moved around the venue, taking autographs of all the writers from across the country. Among them was the historian RA Padmanabhan, who was solely responsible for documenting Bharathiyar’s life and works. He took the autograph book from me and wrote in his beautiful handwriting, “Bharathiyai Padi”, meaning Read Bharathi. I was totally inspired by this and began savouring and discovering the remarkable writings of this great poet, over the years.
Though subject to tremendous inner tribulations, Bharathi sought and perceived harmony in all his life experiences. Nature in all her manifestations was an abiding source of inspiration for him which he narrated in many of his works.
For Bharathi, not only human beings, but even common birds like crows and sparrows were representatives of Cosmic Consciousness. He wrote:
Kakkai Kuruvi engal jaathi - neel 
Kadalum malaiyum engal koottam
Nokkum thisaiyellam naam andri vaerillai 
Nokka nokka kaliyaattam
(Crows and sparrows are our fellows,
The sea and the hills are our kinsmen.
Wherever I look, I find none but myself, 
Mere looking around brings boundless joy)
My quest to fathom the vast creative outpourings of this remarkable poet continues unabated…
12/09/22, 11:48 am - Nalini N R: What a fantastic message. The more we isolate ourselves from the world 'as others and me' and ignore nature which has been showing its presence, we are in for trouble. And the sparrow, a sweet memory in the minds of caged City dwellers. Thanks for the wonderful photograph Sir.
12/09/22, 4:45 pm - Dr Raguram: Yesterday I wrote about how Mahakavi Bharathiyar sought to glimpse the cosmic consciousness through a crow in his poems.
Ikkyu was a beloved  figure in Japanese Buddhism. On one occasion when he was meditating in a boat, he heard the call of a crow and realized the ever elusive enlightenment. 
He was a renegade Zen monk, much ahead of his time. Once he was walking in a town’s streets in his monk’s robes, carrying a long red sword. He was an incongruous sight. When asked what he meant by his act, he responded, “This is a wooden sword; it cannot cut. The priests that run rampant in this world are like my wooden sword here…handsome fakes that are utterly useless”.
If only we realise that wisdom…

13/09/22, 5:51 pm - Dr Raguram: Today is Roald Dahl Day, a special day to remember the prolific author who wrote scores of children's books. 
He was incredibly creative and came up with more than 500 new words such as Oompa-Loompas and scrumdiddlyumptious and the Oxford University Press even came up wit a special dictionary of his imaginary words!
I particularly like his book Matilda', which was later made into a movie. It is about an exceptionally talented, precocious little girl, who is, unfortunately, was never properly recognised by her parents. Amazingly self-motivated, she explores ways of quenching her thirst for knowledge. She was a voracious reader and a dreamer. 
As the author remarks, “The books transported her into new worlds and introduced her to amazing people who lived exciting lives. She went on sailing ships with Joseph Conrad. She went to Africa with Ernest Hemingway and to India with Rudyard Kipling. She travelled all over the world while sitting in her little room in an English village”. 
The books conveyed a reassuring message to Matilda that she was not alone in a largely uncaring world.
13/09/22, 10:31 pm - Nalini N R: Such a beautiful story, a memorable journey with great people. What a catchy photograph Sir. And the words are absolutely true. It reminds me of Dalai Lama!
14/09/22, 9:09 am - Dr Raguram: When Ahalya and myself dedicated Disha, the learning resource center at the tribal school in Wayanad, we were keen to initiate training and skill building in the use of computers for the children there.
We’re happy to share that the Fragomen Immigration Services Ltd, based in Kochi has donated twenty laptops to take this initiative further. We gratefully acknowledge the Managing Director of Fragomen and Mr Kurian in particular for their generous gesture and support. We also thank Mr Antony Joseph, New Zealand for facilitating it.
NABARD Wayanad has expressed their interest to start the training program which will be mentored by Ms Pritha from our Enhanced Learning Environment program.
Hope this opens up gates of learning and expands the  horizons of life for children…

15/09/22, 8:30 am - Dr Raguram: Today is the birthday of the talented Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.
Last year I chanced upon a slender book of hers, ‘Notes on Grief“. Her father died suddenly when the COVID-19 pandemic was raging across the world. It is a searing, reflective account by the author as she struggles through the most unsettling of human experiences, grief.
Often we find it difficult to say the right words and express our feelings to offer succour to those in throes of grief. As the author comments evocatively, “you learn how much grief is about language, the failure of language and the grasping for language”.
Grieving is both a public as well as private act and there have been many poignant personal memoirs about it. These have created spaces where people can share their experiences freely and openly. They are not accounts of  “the stages of grief “ which professionals are accustomed to, but intimate, organic responses to loss. Grief is a kinetic mixture of love and pain. The process of mapping the contours of these experiences can often be therapeutic. It is a passage to another state of ‘being’ in the journey of life. 
That said, grief doesn’t disappear…it reverberates deeply within, all through our lives.

17/09/22, 8:10 am - Dr Raguram: Today is Ken Kessey’s birthday. He was a maverick who was adept in donning various hats. He was a wrestler, a set designer, writer and an enthusiastic propagator of psychedelics. 
His forays into the interior landscapes of the mind began when he volunteered at a hospital to be a subject of experiments with psychomimetic drugs. There was a dramatic change in his explorations when he took a job as a night attendant in a psychiatric ward of a big hospital. Watching the patients there convinced him that they were locked into a system that was the very opposite of therapeutic, and it provided the raw material for his magnum opus ,''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.''
It is a truly remarkable novel which offered insightful accounts of institutionalisation and its psychological impact. It was later made into a popular movie that won many Oscars. However Kessey was not happy with the production and refused to watch the film. 
I am particularly drawn to this passage in the novel:
“You got to understand that as soon as a man goes to help someone, he leaves himself wide open.”
The encounter between a client and the therapist is not a one way process. Invariably the tumultuous emotional turmoil of the client leaves its footprints on the therapist too. In order not to feel overwhelmed and helpless, the therapist has to acknowledge and be aware of it as the impact might play out in their personal lives and in therapy too. In order to be helpful, the therapist must acquire the capacity to locate himself/herself in two parallel realities: the personal and the professional lives and their demands.
Therein lies the necessity and importance of personal supervision for the therapists…
17/09/22, 9:28 pm - Dr Raguram: Yesterday was the Vishwakarma Jayanthi.

21/09/22, 8:38 am - Dr Raguram: Today is the birthday of Leonard Cohen, one of the most passionate songwriter and musicians.
His was an extraordinarily turbulent life. Depression was his lifelong nemesis. Treatments were of little help. After reading Balsekar’s book, ‘Consciousness Speaks’ he came down to Bombay and stayed on for a year, meeting him everyday. At the end of his stay, the depression lifted miraculously and in his own words, “There is a crack in everything. That’s how the light gets in”
Though I like many of his songs (who can forget Suzanne!”, ‘Bird On The Wire’ has a particular appeal for me. It was written during his early years, while he was staying on the Greek island of Hydra. During this period, he fell in love with Marianne Ihlen and theirs was a tempestuous relationship. It was not easy living and the town had no electricity amongst other problems. When the government finally installed the necessary infrastructure, the wires stretched across Leonard Cohen’s windows. As Marianne Ihlen recounted, “While we’re sitting there, birds were landing on the wire like notes on a music sheet.” She brought Cohen his guitar and he began to compose the song that became one of his greatest successes.
After they’d been together for eight years, the relationship came apart, bit by bit, “like falling ashes,” as Cohen put it. Later in her life Marianne was diagnosed to have cancer.
Hearing about it, Leonard Cohen wrote a poignant letter:
“Well Marianne, it’s come to this time when we are really so old and our bodies are falling apart and I think I will follow you very soon. Know that I am so close behind you that if you stretch out your hand, I think you can reach mine. And you know that I’ve always loved you for your beauty and your wisdom, but I don’t need to say anything more about that because you know all about that. But now, I just want to wish you a very good journey. Goodbye old friend. Endless love, see you down the road”.
In her last hour her friend held Marianne’s hand and hummed “Bird on the Wire,” as her life slowly ebbed away…
21/09/22, 10:26 pm - Nalini N R: Very moving Sir
And good to note that he found solace in our interpretation of consciousness. As usual very apt photograph and will listen to the song.

22/09/22, 7:48 am - Dr Raguram: During the 1960’s Chennai underwent a long drought. There was no rain for a couple of years consecutively and as a result the entire city was in the grip of acute water scarcity. It was a tough period when people were desperately trying to get even a bucket of water. I distinctly recall getting up early and trying to get some water from the handpump. An hour of effort would fill two or three buckets of water. Water was a precious, elusive commodity and our everyday lives were woven around it. 
This was the setting for one of the greatest of Tamil novels, Thanneer (water), written by Ashkomitran whose birthday falls today. He narrates with much  sensitivity people's endless search for the elusive water. They wait in long queues bearing insults to get some water. The officials pay scant attention to their travails, digging up roads and linking drain water pipes with drinking water pipes in the process. It is ironic that the main character of the novel is named Jamuna, one of the most polluted rivers in India. Chennai was veritably a wasteland akin to the Sangam landscape, Paalai. The author wonderfully juxtaposes the crisis for water with the lives of three women who are struggling to overcome injustice in their own individual lives. 
At a personal level I could connect with the novel deeply and have had long conversations about it with the author who was a close family friend.
Water is a key element for human survival and I wonder whether we will end up not very far in a similar situation and plight as narrated in this novel.
22/09/22, 9:33 pm - Dr Raguram: Khaggavisana Sutta is one of the earliest, authentic expressions of Buddhist thought.
In it, rhinoceros is used as a metaphor to highlight “the value of living the solitary, wandering life”
One of verses in it states:
Abandoning barriers to awareness,
Expelling all defilements
Being non-dependent,
Avoiding affection,
Wander alone
Like a rhinoceros…

He was a poet of rebellion and his poetry was infused with ‘veer rasa’. Greatly influenced by Rabindranath Tagore, he translated his works to Hindi. When he received the Jnanpith award,Harivansh Rai Bachchan wrote that he should get four Jnanpith awards - for poetry, prose, languages and for his service to Hindi. 
In his ‘Sanskriti ke Chaar Adhyay’, he wrote that despite various cultures, languages and topography, India stands united, because "however different we may be, our thoughts are one and the same".
He was truly a man ahead of his times and in ‘Samar Shesh Hai’, he wrote:
“Kumkum? Lepun kise? Sunaun kisko komal gaan?
Tadap raha aankhon ke aage bhookha hindustan,
Sakal desh mein halaahal hai, Dilli mein haala hai.
Dilli mein roshni, shesh Bharat mein andhiyala hai”
(“To whom should I sing sweet melodies?
The nation is starving in front of our own eyes.
The whole country is churning the poison, while Delhi is enjoying its wine.
Darkness is prevailing in the whole country while Delhi shines”)
When I was looking for an English translation of his poetry, came upon an excellent translation of his poem, ‘Parichay’, and have quoted a few lines from it which appealed to me,in my photograph…
23/09/22, 11:12 pm - Nalini N R: Artists and writers convey the message so beautifully, at the same time give razor's sharpness to their observation!
25/09/22, 8:12 am - Dr Raguram: Colour is all around us and plays a crucial role in paintings. In figurative art where the subject matter is recognizable from the real world, they are employed to complement and enhance their representation. What if there’s no element of figures in a painting?
Decades ago when I was strolling through the National Gallery of Art in London, I walked into a room where there was a large painting of rectangles in brilliant hues, alternatingly radiant. A woman was sitting, totally engrossed in the painting with tears rolling from her eyes. I gingerly stepped out of the room without disturbing her.
Several days later, I went again to the museum and sat in front of the painting. The large canvas was suffused with a delicate yet powerful luminosity. Slowly my eyes soaked in the colours which seemed to percolate deeply within. It was an experience beyond words, beyond language. It was akin to a meditative state when the chatter of the mind quietens and there’s an inexplicable stillness.  
In the words of Sogyal Rinpoche,  “Our true nature could be compared to the sky, and the confusion of the ordinary mind to clouds. Some days the sky is completely obscured by clouds. When we are down on the ground, looking up, it is very difficult to believe there is anything else there but clouds. Yet we only have to fly in a plane to discover a limitless expanse of clear blue sky. From up there the clouds we assumed were everything seem so small and so far away down below”

26/09/22, 7:28 am - Dr Raguram: Our lives are long journeys of explorations, many of them in unexpected, uncharted territories. In our sojourns, we confront and negotiate the great imponderables like the meaning and purpose of life, the inevitable end of life and the mystery of what lies beyond. In each of these encounters we come close to ourselves and discover things anew.
TS Eliot, whose birthday falls today, expressed this succinctly in the poem, ‘Little Gidding’, which forms part of the “Four Quartets”.
He wrote:
“We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.”
26/09/22, 10:22 pm - Nalini N R: It is so thought provoking and meaningful Sir. River and Sea. Interpret as Jeevathma and Parabrahma?

30/09/22, 7:29 am - Dr Raguram: The poet WS Merwin whose birthday is today, had a spiritual connection with nature, especially in his later years. He went to Hawaii to study with the Zen master Robert Aitken and remained there, purchasing land on a place aptly called Haiku. He painstakingly restored depleted flora, including hundreds of species of palms, creating in the process one of the largest collections of palms in the world. 
And the foliage started to bloom in his poems…
In the poem ‘Place’ he wrote:
On the last day of the world
I would want to plant a tree
what for
not the fruit
the tree that bears the fruit
is not the one that was planted
I want the tree that stands
in the earth for the first time
with the sun already
going down
and the water
touching its roots
in the earth full of the dead
and the clouds passing
one by one
over its leaves
When I was watching the migratory Bar Headed Geese which fly across several thousand miles to reach the lake Hadinaru Kere near Mysore, I was reminded of his poem, ‘Migration’:
Prayers of many summers come
to roost on a moment
until it sinks under them
and they resume their journey
flying by night
with the sound
of blood rushing in an ear
30/09/22, 1:43 pm - Nalini N R: The more we are closer to nature the more we grow spiritually. When I was reading Ramayana, the description of the Great Ganges, Yamuna, Chitrakoota mountain and the description of nature gave the virtual treat. The contribution  of people like the poet you have mentioned goes a long way to protect our earth Sir. And the poem!

04/10/22, 6:08 am - Dr Raguram: During Navarathri, Shakti is worshipped in her three manifestations. The first three days are for the worship of Mahakali (power of performing activities), Lakshmi is venerated during the next three days and the last three days are dedicated to Saraswathi, who symbolises the power of knowledge. Saraswathi, supreme icon of wisdom and the arts, is often depicted seated, holding a veena in her hands. Raja Ravi Varma’s painting of a seated Saraswathi can invariably be found in many Indian homes.
Sculptural representations of Saraswathi dancing are comparatively infrequent and are often found in the temples of the Hoysala period. This particular one is from Chennakesava temple at Somanathapura. Intricately chiseled, it exudes innate beauty and grace. The Goddess is seen dancing with one leg planted on the ground while raising the other one, bent at the knee. This is referred to as the urdhvajanuchari pose. She is holding an eka tantri veena in her hands and the ornamentation is detailed and exquisite. She is dancing to the beats of the drummer who can be seen in the lower right corner. Since the material used was soft chloritic schist stone, some of the details have been lost with vagaries of time, made worse by uncaring visitors who rub their hands over it with sheer disdain.
Dynamic, creative energy seems to flow from every inch of this visual interpretation of  Goddess Saraswathi.
In the words of Mahakavi Bharathiyar…
குலவு சித்திரம் கோபுரம் கோயில்
ஈதனைத்தின் எழிலிடையுற்றாள்
இன்பமே வடிவாகிட பெற்றாள்
In beauteous paintings, temple towers
She manifests
As an epitome of joyful grace

04/10/22, 11:12 pm - Nalini N R: Natya Saraswathi with weapons as well as veena. A visual treat Sir🙏🏻
05/10/22, 8:13 am - Dr Raguram: The salient myth associated with Vijayadasami is that of the Goddess vanquishing the demon Mahishasura. It is interesting to note that Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva combined their powers to trounce the demon who had been granted his wish that he would not be annihilated by a male of any species. However he never thought that a woman would be capable of defeating him. But this underestimation of the power of women turned out to be his downfall. 
This myth is a pointer to the inherent, underestimated and unacknowledged energy of the feminine spirit. Moreover it draws attention to the fact that the ‘evil’ often resides within us and it is imperative to address and annihilate it.
This sculpture is from the temple at Gangaikondacholapuram. In contrast to many fierce depictions of the Goddess, one can perceive the tranquil expression on her face after she subjugates and decimates the demon.
05/10/22, 8:13 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
05/10/22, 5:00 pm - Nalini N R: Wonderful sculpture Sir. Yes.  The energy to fight as well as the tender feelings to foster!
07/10/22, 7:56 am - Dr Raguram: Considered as the ‘great voice of Victorian England,’ Tennyson had a troubled legacy. He was subjected to trenchant denunciations by literary critics during his lifetime. It impacted his mental health and ailing from depression, he lamented: 
“When in my youth the growls!
In mine age the owls! 
After death the ghouls!”
But his works had considerable public appeal. When he died on October 6th 1892, scores of people applied for tickets to his funeral in Westminster Abbey.
Tennyson built upon the foundations of Romantic poets and shared their reverence for nature. He commented ,“Words, like nature, half reveal and half conceal the soul within.”
Artists often use Tennyson’s poetry to inspire their works. I found my muse in a corner of a garden which aptly embodies these words of his…
“Flower in the crannied wall, 
I pluck you out of the crannies, 
I hold you here, root and all, in my hand, 
Little flower—but if I could understand 
What you are, root and all, all in all, 
I should know what God and man is.”

08/10/22, 2:35 pm - Nalini N R: The great yester year poets were also philosophers. They not only observed nature but went into the depth of understanding nature, in the process, our true Godly nature! Thank you Sir for the clips and the photograph!
09/10/22, 7:04 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
09/10/22, 7:04 am - Dr Raguram: There is something magical about being in nature. You cannot put it in words, but you feel it deep within…it touches your spirit. Just a few minutes of being in nature can make us feel healed and restored. When we walk amidst the trees and reconnect with nature, an indescribable stillness will inescapably pervade within.
John Muir observed this perceptively, “Nature’s peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees. The winds will blow their own freshness into you, and the storms their energy, while cares will drop away from you like the leaves of Autumn.”
As we usher in another World Mental Health Day, let us strive to discover the healing power of nature…
In Rache Carlson’s words, “Those who dwell among the beauties and mysteries of the earth are never alone or weary of life.”
09/10/22, 4:51 pm - Nalini N R: Very true Sir. And wonderful photograph 👌🏻
10/10/22, 7:33 am - Dr Raguram: Libraries figured prominently during my formative years. I accompanied my writer mother whenever she visited them (which was quite often), for her reference work. I used to enjoy climbing up the ladders just to feel the leather bound old books stacked in tall shelves in the cavernous Connemara Library.
RK Narayan (whose birthday is today10th October), captured that experience quite eloquently. He wrote “faint aroma of gum and calico that hangs about a library is as the fragrance of incense to me. I think the most beautiful sight is the gilt-edged backs of a row of books on a shelf. The alley between two well-stocked shelves in a hall fills me with the same delight as passing through a silent avenue of trees. The colour of a binding-cloth and its smooth texture gives me the same pleasure as touching a flower on its stalk.”
During my school days, the stern looking librarian would silently hand over RK Narayan’s books which I used to read and reread many times. Swami and friends kept me company on many afternoons.
Later in life, RK Narayan commented on issues of topical interest. For instance, he remarked, “If someone should ask, ‘how should an Opposition function?’, the best answer would be, ‘in the manner of a traditional mother-in-law who watches the performance of household work by a daughter-in-law and follows her about with her comments.”
That kind of mother-in-law seems elusive now!
10/10/22, 7:33 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
10/10/22, 5:33 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. Even I used to love visiting libraries and especially the Cubbon Park library. The silent halls filled with old books and the ambience can equal nothing. 
Whenever I saw Dr. Sigmund Freud's library filled with books I used to envy that! And opposition especially in the government the comment is not about the work but shaming the person and party.
12/10/22, 10:24 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
12/10/22, 10:24 am - Dr Raguram: Sometimes  in the morning I sit on the deck, looking at this Buddha, listening to the sonorous rendering of Mahaparinibbana Sutta which describes the last days of Buddha. Though the recitation is in Pali, an all pervading sense of peace transcends the lyrics.
 In his teachings Buddha emphasised the concept of Nibbāna, a Pali word for the extinguishing of a fire. A burning fire clings onto its fuel. When it extinguishes, it lets go of it, merging into the cosmos, reaching a state of unbounded freedom. 
Buddha elaborated this analogy further in his Addittapariyaya Sutta, commonly known as the Fire Sermon, when he addressed his disciples:
“And what is all that is burning? Bhikkhus, the eye is burning, visible forms are burning, visual consciousness is burning, visual impression is burning, also whatever sensation, pleasant or painful or neither-painful, nor pleasant, arises on account of the visual impression, that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of craving, with the fire of hate, with the fire of delusion; I say it is burning with birth, ageing and death, with sorrows, with lamentations, with pains, with griefs, with despairs.”
Though the imagery is stark, Buddha draws attention to how  suffering is caused by these sensory inputs which fill our minds and hearts with simmering fires of desire and hatred. The quest in life is to quell these fires and find peace within.
12/10/22, 10:32 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. Fire fighting! Can the above be handled by understanding My Self?
12/10/22, 10:43 pm - Dr Raguram: Yes
13/10/22, 7:47 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
13/10/22, 7:47 am - Dr Raguram: My tryst with Buddhist thought and teaching continues…
Over the years, I have been drawn to the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh.
Caught in the throes of the Vietnam war, he was in a dilemma. Should he confine himself to the monastery and practice meditation or go out and help people? He decided to venture outside and assist people in distress and also be mindful in doing so. This transition from introspection to action laid the foundation for the practice of  ‘Engaged Buddhism’.
He outlined fourteen precepts of Engaged Buddhism. Two of them in particular have made a deep impression on me. To begin with, truth has to be found in life and not through conceptual knowledge. It is important to engage and learn throughout life by observing within and becoming aware of oneself. The other one is to be cognizant of the existence of suffering in the world and explore ways of attending and redressing it. He articulated his thoughts about the reality of suffering perceptively in his book, No Mud No Lotus, ““If you know how to make good use of the mud, you can grow beautiful lotuses.”
Thich Nhat Hanh also drew attention to how mindfulness can increase our awareness about Mother Earth. “People usually consider walking on water or in thin air a miracle. But I think the real miracle is not to walk either on water or in thin air, but to walk on earth. Every day we are engaged in a miracle which we don't even recognize: a blue sky, white clouds, green leaves, the black, curious eyes of a child—our own two eyes. All is a miracle.”
These words resonate within whenever I take a stroll and observe the beauty and mystery around me.
Thich Nhat Hanh (whose birthday was on 11th October), opened a vivid personal window of awareness for me…
13/10/22, 7:39 pm - Nalini N R: True Sir. I have heard some of his talks on you tube and very captivating indeed. We have inflated the importance of the materialistic world and pushed very simple but fundamental aspects of life into the background. The kind smile on his face is contagious.
14/10/22, 8:23 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
14/10/22, 8:23 am - Dr Raguram: It was an unusually cold afternoon in Bangalore (several years ago!) and when I entered the Select Bookshop, Mr Murthy’s warm smile dissipated the chillness instantaneously. Entering Select Bookshop is like stepping back in time. Every inch of the small interior was filled with old books. As I was rummaging through the crowded bookshelves filled with inky treasures, Mr Murthy picked out a book and asked me whether I’ve read  cummimngs. Taking up his suggestion, I bought the book. 
Later on, when I went through it, I was struck by the innovative and idiosyncratic way he used form, grammar, and syntax in his poems. They were free-form poems mainly in lowercase with unconventional  typographic detailing. 
It was an uneven collection. But one particular poem titled, [somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond], caught my attention. In my MD exam written paper when there was a question on empathy, I took the liberty of quoting a few lines from the poem. During the viva, the examiner Dr Sarada Menon commented with a twinkle in her eyes to the other examiners, “look at this fellow quoting poetry in his exam paper!” These are those lines:
your slightest look easily will unclose me
though i have closed myself as fingers,
you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens
(touching skilfully,mysteriously) her first rose
ee cummimngs wrote many poems in celebration of the natural world. I’ve quoted some of his lines in this appended photograph of mine. ee cummings also dappled in painting. When I was looking through some of his works, I was struck by its similarity with my photograph!
Today is ee cumming’s birthday…
14/10/22, 10:50 pm - Nalini N R: Wonderful photograph and yes what a similarity. The simile between empathy and the poem is very apt Sir. I was wondering if it was typo error when I read the lines on the photograph 🙂
14/10/22, 11:01 pm - Dr Raguram: It is dabbled and not dappled! The two letters got inverted🙂
14/10/22, 11:03 pm - Nalini N R: Oh

15/10/22, 8:04 am - Dr Raguram: Hindi poet Suryakant Tripathi Nirala died on this day in 1961.
He gave voice to the marginalised sections of the society in his works. In a poem titled, “Wah Todti Patthar” he narrated the torment of a woman breaking stones for a living. This has been  translated into English by another poet, Arvind Krishna Mehrotra. There is also another version by the historian Romila Thapar. 
BREAKING STONES
Beside a road in Allahabad,
I saw her
       breaking stones.
 
No tree to give her shade,
A dark skin,
Firm, tightly-cupped breasts,
Eyes fixed on the ground,
Thoughts of the night before
Going through her mind,
She brought down the heavy hammer
Again and again, as though it was
A weapon in her hand.
Across the road—
A row of trees, high walls,
The mansions of the rich.
 
The sun climbed the sky.
The height of summer.
Blinding heat, and the loo blowing hard,
Scorching everything in its path.
The earth under the feet
Like burning cotton wool,
The air filled with dust and sparks.
It was almost noon,
And she was still breaking stones.
 
As I watched,
She looked at me once,
Then at the houses opposite,
Then at her ragged clothes.
Seeing there was no one around,
She met my eyes again
With eyes that spoke of pain<br.
But not defeat.
 
Suddenly, there came the notes of a sitar,
Such as I had not heard before.
The next moment her young body
Quivered and as sweat
Trickled down her face, she lifted
The hammer, resuming work,
As though to say,
       I’m breaking stones.
(The photo is not mine and is from the net!)

17/10/22, 8:19 am - Dr Raguram: The Elkhorn Slough near Monterey Bay in California, is a magical place teeming with wonderful birds and marine mammals. 
When we visited the place sometime back, it was a charming sight to see the endearing antics of the sea otters.
Today when I was reading Ainkurunooru, I was amazed to read a description of otters and the manner in which it was used in a poem. 
Dating back to the early third century, Ainkurunooru is a collection of five hundred poems which narrate the sadness, joys, jealousies and quarrels of lovers in exquisite detail.
For instance, in this poem, the man comes back to his wife after a tryst with his courtesan. Even though he tries of placate her, she rejects his advances:
பொய்கைப் பள்ளிப் புலவுநாறு நீர்நாய்
வாளை நாளிரை பெறூஉ மூர
எந்நலந் தொலைவ தாயினும்
துன்னலம் பெருமபிறர்த் தோய்ந்த மார்பே.
You are coming from a town where otters
Smell of sea fish that they eat everyday;
Though I might wither away in your absence, its fine
I won’t embrace the chest that hugged other women.
It is indeed a striking metaphor!
17/10/22, 11:19 am - Nalini N R: Poets I think have an intrinsic talent to observe nature, adapt to the situations and ability to verbalise👌🏻

18/10/22, 7:49 am - Dr Raguram: There are many schools of thought and myriad interpretations concerning Zen. 
I first read the book, ‘Introduction to Zen Buddhism’ by DT Suzuki (whose birthday is today), decades ago. This edition had a wonderful foreward by CG Jung. 
Zen differs from all other philosophical and religious meditative practices in staying clear of conjectures and presuppositions. Even focusing attention on Buddha has to be avoided as he too is an image. On the other hand, the emphasis is on the immediacy of experience that is beyond words, spontaneous and not premeditated. 
As Suzuki commented, “No amount of wordy explanations will ever lead us into the nature of our own selves. The more you explain, the further it runs away from you. It is like trying to get hold of your own shadow. You run after it and it runs with you at the identical rate of speed.” 
Often such illuminating experiences emerge from nature itself…
18/10/22, 11:59 am - Nalini N R: So very true and the path is straight and simple even for the lay people. But what is required is constant practice and awareness amidst ongoing turmoil in the world. Thank you Sir for the post.

19/10/22, 7:26 am - Dr Raguram: Brown Pelican is an interesting bird to watch, especially when it engages in the ‘head throw’ behaviour. It throws its head into the air while arching its back to stretch its neck and gular pouch. The pouch measures from six to ten inches in depth and is capable of holding several gallons of water. This manoeuvre is reportedly a means to maintain the health and elasticity of pouch skin, But the ‘head throw’ becomes handy when it attempts to catch a fish.   Pelicans are plunge divers and dive into the water with force. Once they catch a fish and come upto the surface, they engage in ‘head throw’ action to swallow the fish head first.
It was wonderful to observe the ‘head throw’ behaviour which lasts for just a few seconds.
As the American humorist Dixon Lanier Merrit wrote in 1913
A wonderful bird is the pelican
His bill can hold more than his belican
(This is often misattributed to Ogden Nash!)
19/10/22, 10:45 pm - Nalini N R: Fantastic photograph Sir. And Dixon's rhyming humor👌🏻

20/10/22, 8:11 am - Dr Raguram: Kurunthokai is the second of the Eight Anthologies in Sangam literature. 
Composed between 100 CE and 300 CE, it contains works by 295 poets.
This particular verse No133 was written by the poet Uraiur Muthukannan Sathanar
புனவன் துடவைப் பொன் போல் சிறு தினை
கிளி குறைத்து உண்ட கூழை இருவி
பெரும் பெயல் உண்மையின் இலை ஒலித்தாங்கு, என்
உரம் செத்தும், உளெனே தோழி, என்
நலம் புதிது உண்ட புலம்பினானே.  
This commentary is by U Ve Swaminatha Iyer who is singularly responsible for bringing classical tamil poetry into the limelight.
கிளி உண்டமையால் கதிர் இழந்த நினைத்தாள் பெரும் பெயலுண்மையால் உலர்ந்து வாடாமல் இலை விட்டதுபோல, தலைவர் உண்டமையால் நலன் இழந்த யான் அவரது நினைத்து உயிர் வைத்துள்ளேன்
In this verse, the heroine laments to her friend:
Hilly tribes plough the land and grow golden yellow millets. Parrots eat the grains and leave the stalks denuded.Yet, when it starts to rain the half eaten stalks sprout fresh leaves. 
I am in a similar situation. I lost my maidenhood with him. Yet I live in the hope that he will come back as promised, like the rain reviving the half eaten stalks.

21/10/22, 9:04 am - Dr Raguram: In our everyday lives, preoccupied with our internal monologues, we stand on the banks of the river of awareness and watch it pass by as if it is ‘out there.’ 
There is a wonderful anecdote about the Zen master Gensha, referred to as the “Great Master Of One Doctrine’. A monk once went to him and wanted to learn where the entrance to the path of truth was. Gensha asked him, "Do you hear the murmuring of the brook?" "Yes, I hear it," answered the monk. "There is the entrance," the master told him.
21/10/22, 12:09 pm - Nalini N R: Yes..... Sir. Looking deeply at  the photograph itself takes us to a serene world... of awareness.

25/10/22, 9:19 am - Dr Raguram: Narakasura who figures prominently in the Deepavali legend has many stories associated with him. He was deemed to have been born from the union of Bhudevi and Varaha. This is a beautiful relief sculpture of Varaha and Bhudevi in the second cave at Badami.
According to the narratives from the North east of India, he was a king who ruled over Pragjyotishapura, which is modern day Assam. He was besotted with the beauty of Devi Kamakhya and wanted to marry her. The Goddess playfully put a condition on him that if he was able to build a staircase from the bottom of Nilachal hills to the temple within one night before the cock crowed to indicate dawn, then she would marry him. Narakasura accepted the condition and worked with all his might and was about to accomplish the task before dawn. When Kamakhya Devi got this news she made a cock to crow to convey the impression that it was already dawn. Angered by this, Narakasura  chased the rooster, slew it and then entered into a battle with the Devi. During the course of the battle, Kamakhya Devi revealed herself as Maa Kali. Realising his mistake, Narakasura fell at her feet and requested that he be remembered as a devotee and not as a demon after his death. Maa Kamakhya granted the same and killed Narakasura with her trident on the Chaturdasi day. The incomplete staircase is known as the Mekhela Ujua Path and is used by devotees even today, to walk to the Kamakhya temple. 
When I was reading about this, I was reminded of Led Zeppelin’s ‘Stairway To Heaven’. 
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all, yeah…
25/10/22, 12:39 pm - Nalini N R: Such a beautiful sculpture clearly depicting Varaha, Bhudevi and Narakasura. And the write up. The wordings in Stairway to Heaven matches so well with the Naraka Chaturdashi. Thank you Sir.

27/10/22, 7:50 am - Dr Raguram: During my Commonwealth fellowship (decades ago!)I used to explore various parts of  the United Kingdom almost every weekend, thanks to the student's pass in the British Rail. The beautiful, untamed Welsh landscape had a special allure for me. During one such visit, I requested my student who was working in Carmarthen to take me to Dylan Thomas’ writing shed. We made our way along Dylan's Walk to a simple, small structure perched on the edge of a cliff. When I peered through the window, I could see some cigarette butts, empty beer bottles and paper strewn on the floor in that sparsely furnished room. The setting sun cast its light through the window, which offered a lovely glimpse of the estuary. I could imagine Dylan sitting there, looking at the landscape which he loved dearly,writing his poems. It was the place where he completed his ‘Under Milk Wood’. 
Dylan died young at the age of 39 after a heavy drinking bout complicated by pneumonia. His life and works have had a lasting impact on many. Bob Dylan changed his last name from Zimmerman in homage to the poet. One can spot Dylan Thomas (just above Marlon Brando) on the iconic cover of the Beatles’ album Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.
Poetry opens our inner world and that is particularly true about Dylan’s  powerfully articulated poem, ‘Do Not Go Gentle Into That Night’ written on the background of his father’s ailment. It set off cascades of inner conversations within me when I was tending to the elderly in our family during their final days. I was caught in a conundrum: as a physician should I facilitate ‘rage, rage against the dying of light’ or quietly observe a life gently ebbing away. This is a predicament for everyone involved in end of life care.
On his birthday today I also wonder whether these lines have a larger canvas and ambit of impact. In the throes of unrelenting climate change, we realise that the earth we live in has a fragile existence and an uncertain future. Dylan was perhaps encouraging us to rage, rage against that  dying light.
Of course there's a lot more to rage about, these days…
27/10/22, 6:29 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. What a picturesque photograph Sir. If the scenic beauty can bring about ripples in a lay person, wonder how it could have impacted a poet. The normal circumstances which we all go through comes out in the form of exquisite poetry in them🤔 Climate change! Blow hot blow cold has become the norm of a day. What all the younger gen has to face😔

08/11/22, 9:04 am - Dr Raguram: Today is Kartik Purnima. According to one of the legends (a lengthy one which I have summarised for sake of brevity), Vidyunmali, Tarakaksha  and Viryavana were three rakshasa sons of Taraka. After getting a boon from Brahma they built three cities, Tripura. They also requested that the only way they could die was if somebody could destroy all three cities with a single arrow. Brahma granted their wish.On Kartik Purnima, Lord Shiva vanquished all of them with a single arrow, putting an end to their reign. This manifestation of Shiva is called Tripurantaka. ("Tri" means Three, "pura" means cities and "antaka" means destroyer.) When the Devatas heard this, they rejoiced and declared the day as Dev Diwali, Diwali for the gods.
This is an exquisite mural in the ceiling of the Rangamantapa of Virupaksha temple at Hampi, which depicts Tripuranataka. In it, four-armed Shiva is shown in a chariot with his right leg in front and the left leg behind and raised. The left hand is holding the bow string on which the arrow is set. The right hand is holding the arrow in horizontal position, which is about to be released. Shiva is sporting a blue dhoti and his body is adorned with jewels. Behind him is a Nagini holding an umbrella and above his shoulder is a kinnar (a celestial musician, half human and half horse) carrying a bell. The sun and the moon at the top of the picture represents twilight. The Tripuras are represented with three circles. When the wheel of the chariot got stuck in the sand, it could not come out even with Lord Shiva’s efforts. In the mural one can see Lord Vishnu in the form of a bull and digging the earth to bring the chariot out.
There is a temple devoted to Tripurantaka, built around 1070 by the Western Chalukyas in Balligave town of Shivamogga district, in Karnataka state.
Incidentally I also found out that there is a cicada in India naed as Meimuna Tripurasura!

11/11/22, 7:40 am - Dr Raguram: Along with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Thich Nhat Hanh has had a deep impact on me, personally as well as in my therapeutic work. I was also drawn to his teaching wherein he emphasized the interconnectedness of the Buddhist way of being and love of nature. According to him, even a simple act of walking mindfully can be a meditative practice. In his words:
Look again, you will see me in you and in every leaf and flower bud.
Walk and touch peace every moment.
Walk and touch happiness every moment.
Each step brings a fresh breeze.
Each step makes a flower bloom.
Kiss the Earth with your feet.
Bring the Earth your love and happiness.
The Earth will be safe
when we feel safe in ourselves.

15/11/22, 9:52 am - Dr Raguram: As I was   strolling across the garden this cup shaped flower in dazzling colour caught my eye. It was gently swaying in the wind. Its name sounded so appropriate when I read about it. The name of this flower comes from the Greek word anemōnē which means ‘the daughter of the wind’. It is a compound of the word ánemos (‘the wind god’) and a feminine suffix ōnē (‘daughter’). 
To paraphrase Victor Hugo, a garden to walk in and to dream in…what more could I ask for?
15/11/22, 7:25 pm - Nalini N R: Simply wonderful Sir. And the colour my favorite. Contrary to 'what is in a name', there is lots in this name!

27/11/22, 8:10 am - Dr Raguram: Jekyll island with its scenic seascapes is one of the charming places in Georgia.
One day while walking amidst tall oak trees dripping with fuzzy tendrils of moss, we chanced upon a building in ruins. A small plaque outside the house mentioned it as the Horton House and offered some details about it.
William Horton was one of the earliest settlers in Jekyll island and built the house in 1736. It was built of tabby, a unique material which was commonly used along the Georgia coast during the 18th and 19th centuries. Tabby was made by burning oyster shells to create lime, then mixing it with water, sand, ash and broken oyster shells. The mixture was then poured into moulds to form blocks with which the structure was built.
Though the house has survived the American revolution, war between the states and hurricane, it is in ruins now with time scarred mould laden walls.
There is something melancholic about an abandoned house in ruins.
As I stepped into a crumbling room with a broken window, the languid rays of the setting sun shone through the trees.
In that fleeting moment, I was transported into the world of those people, long forgotten, who would have looked through that window on many evenings.
And the place came alive….
27/11/22, 10:19 pm - Nalini N R: Ecofriendly construction lasted so long! What a view through the broken window. Remnants reminding the past....

29/11/22, 7:25 am - Dr Raguram: Both Ahalya and myself are Beatles aficionados. We have a good collection of their music (as LPs!) and listen to them often.
George Harrison was the most spiritual of all the Beatles. His tryst with Eastern music and religion was kindled by Ravi Shankar. The first time he used a sitar riff was in ‘Norwegian Wood’. He read extensively. In his own words, "I had read enough from the Vivekenandas and Yoganandas, to comprehend how to see God: by using the Yogic system of transcending through the relative states of consciousness to get to the most subtle level of pure consciousness. It is at that level that the individual experiences pure awareness, pure consciousness, the source of all being…” 
His engagement and involvement in spiritual pursuits finds reflection in many of his songs. I particularly like ‘The Inner Light’. The lyrics are inspired by a section of the Tao Te Ching, written by Lao Tsu, a contemporary of Confucius. There are 81 short chapters of Tao Te Ching. "Inner Light" is the title of Chapter 47, which in translation reads as:
Without going outside, you may know the whole world
Without looking through the window, you may see the ways of heaven
The farther you go, the less you know
Thus the sage knows without travelling
He sees without looking
He works without doing
Harrison's tweaked theses lines a bit, yet essentially conveying its inherent meaning:
Without going outside of your door
You can know all things on earth
Without looking out of your window
You could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing
When George died on 29th November 2001, Ravi Shankar was by his side as verses from the Bhagavad Gita were chanted. His ashes were later immersed in the Ganges as per his wish.

20/12/22, 8:20 am - Dr Raguram: After birding around the Coyote hills, when we ventured into the Arastradero Preserve, in Santa Clara county, the call of the acorn woodpecker welcomed us. Its call was reportedly the inspiration for the cartoon character, Woody Woodpecker! The story goes that Walter Lantz, the creator of the cartoon character and his new bride, Grace, were on their honeymoon in a cabin in California. They were disturbed by a loud sound as if someone was laughing. When they went out to check, they spotted an Acorn Woodpecker, pounding away at the roof nonchalantly and Woody was born!
The terrain of the preserve was largely grassland with great old oak trees. When I saw this magnificent tree with its bare branches, I was struck by its resemblance to mysterious neural networks in our brain.
There is always something of an unknown presence embedded in such knotty tangles…
20/12/22, 10:20 pm - Nalini N R: Absolutely eye catching Sir. And what a comparison. There is a saying in Kannada, what Sun can't see a poet sees!

21/12/22, 10:11 am - Dr Raguram: Shab e Yalda which is ushered in tonight is one of the ancient Persian festivals. On the longest and darkest day of the year, people get together to celebrate the “rebirth of the sun”. According to an old Persian belief, sunrise the following day will remove darkness from people’s lives with its radiance. It brings together family and friends to pass the longest and darkest night of the year in good company and cheer and as a tradition, verses from two famous poets, Hafez and Sa’adi are recited on the occasion.
21/12/22, 10:49 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. Such a wonderful message. I feel there is absolutely no contradiction amongst the sayings of realised souls from any part of the world including poets who were great thinkers.

23/12/22, 1:37 pm - Nalini N R: What a photograph and a very apt saying. I myself have experienced the above but very important to come out of the narrowed thinking about I me and mine. It's then we can be 'the light'.

06/01/23, 10:49 am - Dr Raguram: On the occasion of Arudra Darisanam dedicated to the cosmic dance of Lord Siva, let me recall my visit to Banteay Srei, the jewel of Khmer Art. Each and every section of this small temple is exquisitely carved. This beautiful depiction of Aada Vallan or Dancing Siva is on the eastern side of the temple. Below him is Indira riding his Airavata, which is depicted as a monster-like figure with an elephant head. Indira (unfortunately his head is missing) is seen holding the elephant trunk on the right hand and the monster head on the left hand. The two other Airvatas are on the corners of the bas relief. On Siva’s left is a percussionist playing on the drum. On the right of Siva is a depiction of an emaciated woman, Karaikkal Ammaiyar. She was a Bhakti poet and one of the three women amongst the 63 Nayanmars, a group of saints devoted to Lord Siva. 
Sekhizhar in his monumental work ‘Periyapuranam’ narrates the story of Karaikkal Ammaiyar. She began her life as Punithavathi and was married to Paramadattan. One day Paramadattan sent two mangoes to her telling her to keep them for his lunch. An hour or so later Lord Siva came as a mendicant, begging for alms. As food wasn’t ready, Punithavathi offered him one of the mangoes. When her husband returned, Punithavathi served him the other one. When he asked for the other one, she was desperate and prayed to Lord Siva and a ripe mango fell into her palm. Finding the fruit bigger and tastier, he asked her where she got it. When she related what had happened, Paramadattan was unconvinced and asked her to procure another such fruit. Punithavathi prayed again and received one more fruit but it vanished when her husband tried to touch it. Taken aback, Paramadattan realised that she had divine qualities and deserted her. Stung by this, she left home to pursue an ascetic path and prayed to Lord Siva to release her from the shackles of the physical body. Hence many iconographic depictions of her portray her in an emaciated form. 
There is a small temple dedicated to her in Karaikkal. Every year Mangani (Mango) festival is celebrated commemorating this story. During this festival Lord Siva is taken in procession as Bikshadana with his begging bowl and people throw mangoes from the rooftops. 
Karaikkal Ammaiyar composed beautiful verses in praise of Lord Siva:
இறவாத இன்ப அன்பு வேண்டிப்பின் வேண்டு கின்றார்
பிறவாமை வேண்டும்,
மீண்டும் பிறப்புண்டேல் உன்னை என்றும் மறவாமை வேண்டும்
இன்னும் வேண்டும்நான் மகிழ்ந்து பாடி
அறவாநீ ஆடும் போதுஉன் அடியின்கீழ் இருக்க.
I pray for the infinite happiness of Your love
I do not want to be born again
If I do, I do not want to forget You forever
If I do, I want to be happily singing in Your praise
Under Your feet as You are dancing”.
06/01/23, 10:53 pm - Nalini N R: Oh it really looks deadly🤔 Sir.
06/01/23, 11:01 pm - Nalini N R: So beautifully carved with so much of intricacy. Looks like a beautiful puzzle. Thank you Sir for the narration. I think Karaikkal Ammaiyar can be compared to Akkamahadevi and Andal amongst Azhwars.

07/01/23, 10:24 am - Dr Raguram: January 5th is celebrated as the National Bird Day in the USA to draw attention to the beauty and importance of birds in the ecosystem.
While birding in the Coyote Hills near San Francisco, I spotted a bird at a distance sallying in the air in a graceful way, much like a butterfly. When it settled down on a branch, I had a close look and it was Say’s Phoebe.
In Greek mythology, Phoebe was the goddess of the hunt and the moon, the daughter of Gaea and the twin sister of Apollo. I was wondering whether this petite flycatcher is called phoebe owing to its prowess in hunting insects. Instead, I gather that the name derives from the kind of sound it makes! American naturalist Thomas Sa was the first scientist to encounter the bird, at a site near Cañon City, Colorado, in 1819 and it was named after him by Charles Bonaparte, a nephew of Napoleon. They have been in the U.S. for a long time. Palaeontologists discovered Say’s Phoebe fossils in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas dating back to about 400,000 years ago (the late Pleistocene).
08/01/23, 5:52 pm - Nalini N R: Wowww Sir. What a photograph 🤔 you have caught the flycatcher from a fantastic angle. Its features are so vivid and can be felt👌🏻

12/01/23, 7:50 am - Dr Raguram: Haruki Murakami, one of my favourite writers, turns 74 today. His latest book Novelist as  Vocation was published in English a few months ago. A collection of essays, it was first published in Japanese seven years ago. The narrative flows in the manner of many of his novels, which are usually written in the first-person.  There are informative insights into his writings. I particularly liked his observation on the art/act of writing: “If possible, I would like my readers to savour that same emotion when they read my books. I want to open a window in their souls and let the fresh air in. This is what I think of, and hope for, as I write—purely and simply.”

14/01/23, 10:48 am - Dr Raguram: 13th December is the last day of the Tamil month Margazhi  which ushers in the Pongal festival. It occurs on the last day of Dakshinayana, a six month cycle of the Sun’s course moving south, which is followed by a six month cycle of the Sun’s course moving north called Uttarayana. 
During Bhogi, people clean their houses, get rid of unwanted things, symbolically setting them on fire. Perhaps it reminds us that we need to give up all our negativities, and unwanted thoughts in the smouldering fire. 
Mythologically it is an invocation to a divine force, Lord Indra, "the God of Clouds and Rains' ',seeking his benevolence to bring in good rains and help the farmers. 
This is a beautifully carved sculpture of Lord Indra with Indrani on his vehicle Airavat, from the 13th century Chennakeshava temple at Somanathpua, near Mysore

19/01/23, 9:58 am - Dr Raguram: The Raven has featured in ancient stories from around the world and in almost every culture. In the book of Genesis, Noah first sent a raven from the ark to determine if the floodwaters had receded. They are perhaps one of the smartest of birds. 
Ravens have fascinated people through history. Edgar Allan Poe, whose birthday is today, was no exception and wrote the poem The Raven in 1845. Who can forget these memorable lines…
“Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?"
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!" —
Merely this, and nothing more” 
This iconic poem launched him from a virtual nobody to an overnight success, but his newfound popularity wasn’t always easy for the writer. Children were known to follow him through the streets, flapping their arms and croaking like a raven. Poe’s response? Shouting “Nevermore!” at them until they ran away.
Incidentally Edgar Allan Poe was a birder!
21/01/23, 10:52 am - Nalini N R: Any poet exists who is not inspired by nature? For people who have been caught up in the maddening crowd, such poems like the above is like a soothing breeze.
22/01/23, 9:36 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
22/01/23, 9:36 am - Dr Raguram: Lord Byron (whose birthday is today) expressed a sense of wonder and joy about nature in his poems. Born with a club foot, he was deeply uncomfortable with it and had to wear special boots to hide it. He was also a victim of childhood sexual abuse at the hands of a drunken nursemaid. For him nature was a healer; a refuge and place of shelter. 
His love of nature finds expression in Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage:
“I live not in myself, but I become
Portion of that around me; and to me,
High mountains are a feeling…
Are not the mountains, waves, and skies a part
Of me and of my soul, as I of them?
Is not the love of these deep in my heart
With a pure passion”
His own inner need for solitude finds expression in these perceptive lines…
“There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
There is society, where none intrudes,
By the deep sea, and music in its roar:”
22/01/23, 5:24 pm - Nalini N R: An enchanting photograph with Byron's lines.... It is only blessed few whose deep pain could find its outlet in lines like the above. Fame is so very secondary and immaterial. Thank you Sir for the beautiful photographs and for opening the treasure trove.

25/01/23, 9:07 am - Dr Raguram: Virginia Woolf (whose birthday is today) had an enduring tryst with bipolar illness all through her life. In her fight against her hounding illness which she often referred to as ‘waves’, she held onto writing to prevent herself from sinking. In her own words, “One ought to sink to the bottom of the sea, probably, and live alone with one’s words.” It was a prescient observation as years later, unable to cope with the devastating illness, she filled her overcoat with stones and drowned in the river Ouse. 
TS Eliot, a close friend, persuaded her to write about her experiences with her ailments and the result was the contemplative essay, ‘On Being Ill’. She wrote it in throes of yet another ravaging bout of illness. This has been reissued in 2012 with contributions from her mother and a friend. It is an insightful narrative about travails of illness and its impact on caregivers.
She voiced her profound loneliness in these evocative words, “We do not know our own souls, let alone the souls of others. Human beings do not go hand in hand the whole stretch of the way. There is a virgin forest, tangled, pathless, in each; a snowfield where even the print of birds’ feet is unknown. Here we go alone…”
26/01/23, 11:09 pm - Nalini N R: Very touching Sir and she has voiced which many can't .And very true. We think and assume we understand someone but a lot goes unsaid. Still...we need to stretch a helping hand....
29/01/23, 9:36 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
29/01/23, 9:36 am - Dr Raguram: When I was ambling along the corridors of the Durga temple at Aihole sometime ago, I noticed a sculpture of a serene, elegant, bejewelled person in a pillar. What caught my attention was a figure of a woman with legs of horse on his left. Unfortunately, her face was disfigured. At that time I was not sure of its iconographic importance.
Yesterday on the occasion of Ratha Saptami, when I was reading about the legends associated with Surya, I wondered whether this sculpture represents Surya and his wife. 
According to the legends, Vishvakarma’s daughter, Sanjana was married to Surya. After bearing him three children, she found his brilliance too oppressive and the heat unbearable. Hence she took the form of a shadow, Chhaya to take her place. Chhaya did not disclose her identity to Surya and had two sons and two daughters from him. Later when Surya realized that Chhaya was not Sanjana he was extremely annoyed and banished Chhaya away.  He went in search of Sanjana and enquired about her whereabouts with her father Vishvakarma who he told him that she was living in the forest. Surya went in search in the forest and found her in the form of a mare and united with her. 
Chhaya who represents darkness was the manifestation of Sanjana who is deemed to be the source of all conscious thought. Ignorance is darkness which is dispelled by the light of awareness.  Not surprisingly, the symbol associated with Sanjana is walnut which has a striking similarity with human brain!
There is plenty to ponder in mythology!

31/01/23, 8:26 am - Dr Raguram: Da Ra Bendre’s (whose birthday is today) works are infused with a sense of divine unity. This is often expressed eloquently in his nature poems. For instance in Ba Bega (Come Soon) he conceives the clouds as a divine presence which can enliven the ‘sleeping seed’ within us…
31/01/23, 10:47 pm - Nalini N R: Oh what a photograph Sir. Such a contrast in colours. Yes Da Ra Bendre Vara kavi known for his poems on nature. I love the poem Moodala maneya muthina neerina and many of his poems are sung as Bhava geethe.

03/02/23, 8:52 am - Dr Raguram: World wetland day is celebrated every year all across the world to commemorate the Convention on Wetlands which was held on 2nd of February in 1971 in the city of Ramsar, Iran at the Caspian Sea coasts. The Ramsar Convention emphasizes the importance of conservation and sustainable management of wetlands. Wherever we live: city, town, village or country, we are surrounded by wetlands which are unfortunately in throes of decline due to excessive urbanisation, shrinking buffer zones and contamination. In an era of intense climate change, wetlands are like the River Styx which separated the world of the living from Hades, the world of the dead. 
It is imperative to recognize the value that wetlands add to our lives and the joy of observing the beautiful flora and fauna that they nurse.
03/02/23, 8:23 pm - Nalini N R: True Sir.

08/02/23, 8:18 am - Dr Raguram: Located in the beautiful Hudson Valley in Ghent, NY, Art Omi is a vast landscape untouched by landscapers or horticulturalists. Amidst the tranquil outdoor space dotted with wild flowers are large scale sculptures. Some works are so well camouflaged in the wooded trails that it is easy to miss them, while others reach out through the trees. When I ventured into a forest path, I chanced upon this wooden sculpture of a man in silent repose, silhouetted against the sky. As I spent a few minutes soaking up the experience, these words of the philosopher Martin Buber (whose birthday is today) resonated within me:  "Solitude is the place of purification".
Solitude often unravels the richness within the self…
08/02/23, 10:55 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. It caught my eye and was wondering if it was a dead  tree but shaped like a man!! So there are still places existing which are not spoilt by human species. The words have so much to say.....A beautiful photograph Sir. Hues of the sky and the trees......
09/02/23, 8:43 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>

13/02/23, 10:16 am - Dr Raguram: Sarojini Naidu, (whose birthday is today) was an exceptionally talented person right from young age. She was actively involved in the freedom struggle and yet found time to pen some exquisite poems. In particular, I am fascinated by the nature poems of the Nightingale of India, which are replete with entrancing, vibrant, imagery. In her poem the Autumn Song, she draws attention to the beauty and frailty of fall with a touch of poignancy. The first two lines are exquisitely eloquent…
Like a joy on the heart of a sorrow,
The sunset hangs on a cloud;
A golden storm of glittering sheaves,
Of fair and frail and fluttering leaves,
The wild wind blows in a cloud.
Hark to a voice that is calling
To my heart in the voice of the wind:
My heart is weary and sad and alone,
For its dreams like the fluttering leaves have gone,
And why should I stay behind?
13/02/23, 8:02 pm - Nalini N R: A fiery sunset just like the light of a lamp before it gets extinguished but to be back and rise again. A beautiful photograph which is a visual treat and an apt one for the caption. The last few lines......

14/02/23, 9:43 am - Dr Raguram: Sanskrit literature is replete with beautiful verses celebrating love. Most notable among them is Chaurapanchasika , a compilation fifty short lyric poems written in the eleventh century A. D. by the poet Bilhana. 
There are many versions about the origin of this work. One of them states that a king with a lovely daughter engages the famous poet Bilhana to educate his daughter. To prevent any romance blossoming between the two, he tells the princess that her guru is visually challenged and tells the guru that his student has deformities in her face. To ensure that they don’t see each other, he hangs a curtain between the two. One day while lessons were in progress, the poet is thrilled by the full moon on a cloudless sky. He breaks into a poem, and princess wonders how a blind man can sing about the moon with such brilliance. Excited, she pulls down the curtain and finds that Bilhana is a handsome young man while he finds he finds her to be a personification of female beauty. The two instantly fall in love and decide to marry, but the enraged king sentences them to death. As Bilhana is being led to his execution, he starts singing the fifty verses. Deeply moved by it, the king orders his release and formally gives his daughter in marriage.
Interestingly, in  1948, two producers made movies in Tamil based on this story of Bilhana. Unfortunately, the third version with the legendary MK Thyagaraja Bhagavathar as Bilhana was never completed as the actor was arrested.
Among many translations of this remarkable work, I find the one by Sir Edwin Arnold quite interesting. One of the verses reads: 
Still when her eyes, as lotus petals long,
Like Fortune’s  goddess lotus-born, I see,
And see her wearied by her bosom's load,
With both my arms clasping her close to me
As honey bee his darling lotus sips,
I would grow drunk on mead within her Iips.
These lines find a picturesque expression in this beautiful sculpture from Khajuraho.
15/02/23, 6:36 pm - Nalini N R: Exquisitely crafted sculpture and interesting narrative Sir.
16/02/23, 9:10 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>

18/02/23, 8:35 am - Dr Raguram: According to one of the legends, Lord Shiva and Devi Parvathi tied the nuptial knot on Mahashivaratri. Their union has a deeper connotation: Purusha (mindfulness) is represented by Shiva, while Prakriti (nature) is epitomized by Parvathi. 
This classic Shiva Parvathi sculpture is from Hoysaleshwara temple in Halebeedu. It depicts Parvathi seated on Shiva’s lap which is referred to as atikarohana. They are bedecked with intricately carved jewellery and carry different weapons and ornaments in their arms. The details are so mesmerizing, providing a three dimensional perspective. What is interesting to note is the presence of mongoose, a vahana of Parvathi at her feet. 
Composed by Adi Shankaracharya, Shiva Parvathi stotram holds a special importance amongst all Shiva Stotras. It extols the divine qualities of the god and goddess in 12 stanzas. On this Mahashivaratri day let us recall a verse from this:
नमः शिवाभ्यां पशुपालकाभ्याम्, 
जगत्रयीरक्षण बद्धहृद्भ्याम् ।
समस्त देवासुरपूजिताभ्याम्,
नमो नमः शङ्करपार्वतीभ्याम् 
Namah Shivabhyam pashupalakabhyam
Jagattrayee rakshana baddha hrudbhyam
Samastha Devaasura pujitabhyam
Namo namah Shankara Parvatibhyam 
I bow to God Shiva and Goddess Parvathi, the protectors of all beings
Who are the divine guardians of all the three worlds
The divine pair worshipped by all the Devas and Asuras
I bow to you, again and again, God Shiva and Goddess Parvathi
18/02/23, 6:39 pm - Nalini N R: A beautiful sculpture Sir🙏 The nuptial knot tied between mind and matter. Parvati through self discipline and determination won Shiva. Beyond idolising connecting to our lives really helps Sir. Thank you for the verse and its interpretation.

21/02/23, 10:23 am - Dr Raguram: In all my forays into the library during my training days at NIMHANS, I was drawn into one particular journal, simply titled as Psychiatry. Tucked between its plain yellow covers were articles that opened up my perspective into the interpersonal context of psychological suffering. One of the founders of the journal was Harry Stack Sullivan, whose birthday is today. Sullivan through his framework of interpersonal psychotherapy articulated that one’s personality and behavior has to be viewed and examined on the background of close, intimate, relationships. He felt that descriptive psychiatry failed to look beyond diagnosis and view the whole person in his/her social context. He extended this orientation to understand what was often viewed as an incomprehensible disease process, schizophrenia. This laid the foundation of the Chestnut Lodge which pioneered intensive, individualized treatment of schizophrenia. Chestnut Lodge was also the locale of the book “I never promised you a rose garden’.
Enforced isolation during the Covid era, drew our attention to the unsettling fact that loneliness can be a severely distressing state. Yet it has eluded the attention of mental health professionals. Sullivan was among the very few who attempted to examine it.  He regarded loneliness as one of the most intense and painful of human experiences and described people with schizophrenia as, “the loneliest of the lonely”.
Personally, the work of Sullivan widened my gaze beyond the veil of symptoms onto the real person shrouded behind them.

22/02/23, 8:54 am - Dr Raguram: We are all drawn into the larger than life canvas of the Father of the Nation. Yet, we fail to notice the gentle brush strokes and fine textures that enhance its subject and the incredible person responsible for it, Kasturba Gandhi. Married at a very young age, she deftly juggled multiple roles: as a devoted wife to a demanding husband, a caring mother and a satyagrahi. It was not an easy task and its demands impacted her health significantly.
22nd February was the last day in the life of Kasturba Gandhi. She was imprisoned along with Mahatma Gandhi in the Aga Khan Palace, Poona and was not keeping good health for a while. When Kasturba realised that her end was near she said, "Do not sorrow after my death. It should be an occasion for rejoicing." Then she whispered a line from her favourite Gujarati hymn, ‘Hari no marag che shoora no, nahi kayar nu kaam jone (The path to God is for the brave to tread, not for cowards). Then she slipped into an altered state of consciousness. When he was told about it, Bapu rushed to her room. took her hand in his and asked, ‘Shun thay che, Kastur?’ In a feeble, trembling voice, Kasturba replied, ‘Shun thay che smajhatu nathi. Mare java no vakhat thai gayo.’ She rested her head on Gandhi’s chest and soon her life ebbed away. 
The next day she was cremated in the grounds of the Aga Khan Palace. Gandhi sat through the cremation till the pyre was extinguished. When someone suggested him to move away he replied, "This is the final parting, the end of 62 years of shared life. Let me stay here till the cremation is over."
When her children Devadas and Ramdas went to collect her ashes, they found to their great surprise, an intact a pair of red and green glass bangles worn by Kasturba since marriage.
22/02/23, 10:20 pm - Nalini N R: Yes sir. Just labelling narrows our understanding of the person. We are a product of messy, intertwined relationships. Decades back had read the book.
22/02/23, 10:25 pm - Nalini N R: A brave heart and an inspiration to all the women👍

23/02/23, 9:43 am - Dr Raguram: When I joined NIMHANS, my teacher Dr RL Kapur told me to read Karl Jasper’s ‘General Psychopathology’. I went over to the library to look for it. In those days, books in the library were all locked up securely in steel cupboards and the keys were with a strict looking female attender. When I requested her to look for it, she went straight to the pathology section and announced in a loud voice that there is no such book. I persuaded her to look for it in the psychiatry section and to my great relief it was there in a bottom shelf. It was the first edition, translated into English by Hoenig, who had spent a year at the All India Institute of Mental Health in 1955. It was a difficult book to read, but I gamely gave it a try over several weeks and re-read it during my training days. Later, I personally wanted to possess a copy of ‘General Psychopathology’ and finally got one in an old book shop. It has a pride of place in my collection. I was going through it today on Jasper’s birthday and was struck by its continuing relevance in the current climate of psychiatric practice. 
The main emphasis of Jasper was on a phenomenological approach to psychiatric illnesses. It is essentially a form of qualitative enquiry that emphasized experiential, lived aspects of a particular phenomenon as described by the person. In Jasper’s own words “Since we never can perceive the psychic experiences of other in any direct fashion, as with physical phenomena, we can only make some kind of a representation of them. There has to be an act of empathy, of understanding ...which comes from the patient’s own self-descriptions, which can be evoked and tested out in the course of personal conversations.” In a Jaspersian sense, psychiatric diagnosis is not a “simple question-and-answer interrogation” but a “particular observation” in the context of an empathic interaction.
Unfortunately, with the advent of the Neo Kraeplinian frameworks of diagnosis, the emphasis has shifted to ‘eliciting’ symptoms which are then straight jacketed to fit into diagnostic criteria. This has led to a robotic checklist approach shorn of insights about the experiential terrain of symptoms. The person who ultimately knows his/her experiences is the patient himself/herself. The psychiatrist’s role is to facilitate expression of this experience through a compassionate, empathic stance tinged with an attitude of curiosity.
23/02/23, 10:55 pm - Nalini N R: Thank you Sir for sharing the above. Tha listening time we spend with the patients definitely helps in understanding, empathising with them. What I have observed is despite the same diagnostic label they get, each patient has her or his uniqueness, strengths and weaknesses. But time matters.....

06/03/23, 8:02 am - Dr Raguram: During our training period at NIMHANS, after receiving our monthly pay, Ahalya and myself will invariably make our way to Premier Book Shop to stock up on books. During one such visit, Shanbhag guided us through the shelves overflowing with books, picked up one and said, “Doctor, you must read this!” 
It was Gabrial Garcia Marquez’s ‘One Hundred Years Of Solitude’.
When I started reading the novel, it was much akin to sojourns in dreamscapes. To borrow a phrase from Beatles, it was a Magical Mystery Tour! Every page was suffused with intricate details, intersecting history, mythology and tradition. The lives and tribulations of the Buendia family came alive in the author’s mesmerizing narrative. 
In a memorable passage after the death of Jose Arcadio Buendia, Gabo’s writes, “When the carpenter was taking measurements for the coffin, through the window they saw a light rain of tiny yellow flowers falling. So many flowers fell from the sky that in the morning the streets were carpeted with a compact cushion and they had to clear them away with shovels and rakes so that the funeral procession could pass by.”
Yellow butterflies were one of his often used literary imagery and he used to comment that nothing awful would happen to him if there are yellow flowers around.
During his memorial service thousands of yellow butterflies made of paper were released to celebrate the life of this remarkable author. 
Today is Gabo’s 96th birthday…

07/03/23, 8:12 am - Dr Raguram: It was an unusually sultry morning and there was a long queue in front of St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican City. Undeterred, I waited patiently behind a group of tourists from America who were chatting animatedly. As soon as I entered its hallowed precincts, I made my way straight to have a glimpse of Michelangelo’s Pieta. During his lifetime Michelangelo made three Pietas, of Virgin Mary mourning the dead body of Christ and this is the most beautiful of them all. Though Mary embracing her dead son is not explicitly mentioned in the holy book, the scene has proven to be a popular subject among artists for centuries.
Safely ensconced behind bullet proof glass, Virgin Mary was in a seated position, wrapped in robes and cradling the lifeless body of Jesus. His head was slumped back on her shoulder. When I looked at it closely, I felt that the sculpture was shaped like a pyramid, with the top of the head of Virgin Mary being its peak and the sculpture expanding to accommodate her seated legs. Her petite face with gentle demeanour exuded serene tranquillity. Michelangelo’s painstaking attention to detail and the unique treatment of the hair, the skin and the intricate folds in the fabric is a lasting testimony to his outstanding artistry.  
Pieta was the only sculpture where Michelangelo inscribed his name. Unfortunately, with the crowd milling around, I couldn’t have a close look to locate it. 
Michelangelo was a multi-talented individual who also wrote sonnets on variety of subjects. He produced hundreds of madrigals and sonnets, often putting down his chisel while at work to write down a line or two of verse.
These beautiful lines are from the sonnet titled The Model and the Statue:
When that which is divine in us doth try
To shape a face, both brain and hand unite
To give, from a mere model frail and slight
Life to the stone by Art’s free energy.
(Yesterday, 6th March was the birthday of this remarkable artist/poet)
08/03/23, 10:27 am - Nalini N R: Pen and chisel, both effective ways to touch heart. So beautifully and humbly put across- shadow of divine perfection. The artist has left to the eyes of the beholder to interpret the expression on Virgin Mary's face!!!

08/03/23, 9:16 am - Dr Raguram: International Women’s Day is observed to recognize and honor the achievements of women. On this day let us recall the life and works of a remarkable woman, Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Educated at home, she wrote an epic poem at the age of twelve. Her first major work was ‘An Essay On Mind and Other Poems’ which was published when she was twenty years old. These lines from it, offer a tantalizing glimpse of her talent:
So when the pilgrim sun is traveling o’er
The last blue hill, to gild a distant shore
He leaves a freshness in the evening scene
That tells the Creation where his steps have been
Unfortunately, much like Frida Kahlo she was beset with various ailments all through her life including a spinal fracture. This was not a dampener in her creative journey and she continued to immerse herself at work, producing some extraordinary verses.
Elizabeth was not just a talented poet, she was deeply involved in addressing many forms of social injustice, such as the slave trade in America, child labour in the mines and the mills of England and the restrictions forced upon women in 19th-century society. Standards of sexual conduct were so rigid at that period in time that any woman who bore a child out of wedlock, even if she had been a victim of male aggression, was shunned and scorned by the society.  She urged that society should be more compassionate in its treatment of women who had been victims of sexual violence. Moved by the plight of children working in mines she wrote a long poem, ‘The Cry of The Children’, with these poignant opening lines:
Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers,
Ere the sorrow comes with years ?
They are leaning their young heads against their mothers, 
And that cannot stop their tears.
Elizabeth Barrett Browning was an extraordinary poet but she was also more than that. Hers was a voice for the oppressed and she had the courage to profess her views that went against the grains of society. 
The theme of this year’s International Women’s Day is ‘Embrace Equity’. Elizabeth Barrett Browning personified this all through her life and in her works.

15/03/23, 7:01 am - Dr Raguram: From the moment we are born, we begin our journey towards death. Understandably this prospect often evokes intense fear. It is suggested that one can negotiate this fear in three ways: through knowledge as epitomized by Nachiketa, by adopting a path of bhakti like Markandeya and by sheer power of love as symbolized by Savitri. 
During Karadaiyan Nombu which is observed today, women offer prayers for the longevity and wellbeing of their husbands and celebrate great encounter of Savitri and Yama, the God of Death. 
Savitri was the daughter of the King of Madradesha. She was exceedingly beautiful and when she reached marriageable age, though many princes admired her, none of them came forward to marry her, overawed by her beauty. Her father told her to go forth and select her own husband. Savitri visited many kingdoms but could not find the husband of her choice. On her way back home, she saw a young man in a forest serving an old couple with utter devotion. She was immediately drawn to him and informed her choice to her father. When Narada heard about it, he informed her that the young man she had chosen, Sathyavan, had a very short life and would die after a year. Savitri’s parents were shattered on hearing this and requested her to reconsider her choice. A determined Savitri married Sathyavan and went to the forest and assumed her new role with great joy. But deep within, she was afraid and could not forget Narada’s prophecy. As the day of death drew near, she began to fast and offer prayers with utmost piety. Finally, on the dreaded day, she decided to accompany her husband when he went into the forest as she did not want to be separated from him even for a short while. Yama made his appearance and starting pulling Sathyavan with his noose. To his astonishment he saw Savitri following him and asked her to return back. But Savitri said that it was her dharma to accompany her husband everywhere and she could not give it up. Pleased with her words he granted her many boons with which she restored the kingdom and eyesight of her father in law. But she still continued to follow him. Finally, impressed by her intense devotion, Yama restored the life of her husband and blessed them.  
Interestingly festivals are associated with particular type of food. Karadaiyan Nombu is no exception. On this day, a special dish ‘Karadai’ is prepared from rice flour, black eyed peas, jaggery and coconut  and it is believed that Savitri prepared this special dish and offered it with butter to Lord Yama as a thanksgiving gesture for returning the life of Satyvan.
There are few representations of Yama in sculptural form. This image is from Khajuraho and depicts a four armed Yama. His vehicle, buffalo can be seen on the lower right hand corner. If one looks carefully, one can notice a cock in his right hand. There is an interesting story behind it. One day Yama attempted to kick his mother in a fit of rage. Incensed by this, Sanjana, his mother cursed that he would have a perennial wound infested with maggots which would never heal. Heeding to his request, Surya granted him a cock which ate all the vermin in his leg. And hence the cock in his hand!
15/03/23, 8:27 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. We do celebrate what we call it as 'Ade pandigai' but dish prepared differently. And well narrated, story of Savitri's determination.

19/03/23, 7:58 am - Dr Raguram: Last week we were at Hadinaru Kere totally immersed in observing perhaps the last flock of the Bar Headed Geese before they head back. There are no idyllic conditions for them to make their long journey thought unforgiving climates.
To me they are icons of life affirming expressions of resilience. 
As humans when we erect walls of beliefs and assumptions around us and fail to and rarely explore the vast horizon of possibilities of our lives, let us feel inspired by these alluring denizens of the air!

20/03/23, 9:23 am - Dr Raguram: White-crowned Sparrows are quite fascinating. They are extremely alert and they stay awake for up to two weeks during their migration. A migrating White-crowned Sparrow was once tracked moving 300 miles in a single night! It is a delightful sight to see them scuttling across the ground with their chirpy notes.
What do sparrows represent? They were associated with liberation in ancient Egypt. It was believed that they would catch the souls of the recently deceased and carry them to heaven. This was the inspiration for a while for sailors to get sparrow tattoos in the hope that the bird would catch their souls if they died at sea. 
Sparrows often have a spiritual connotation. Mahakavi Bharathiyar wrote a couple of poems on this dainty bird. Here, he urges us to let go of the chains of bondages that hold us back and liberate ourselves from the fetters that bind us…like the sparrow
விட்டு விடுதலை யாகிநிற் பாயிந்தச்
சிட்டுக் குருவியைப் போலே
May you escape from all shackles
And revel in freedom
Like this Sprightly Sparrow
(On the occasion of the World Sparrow Day)
20/03/23, 1:43 pm - Nalini N R: Resilience and these geese. I feel humans have complicated their lives and lost focus. Wonder what purpose their intelligence is serving!
20/03/23, 1:46 pm - Nalini N R: Heart warming photograph Sir and good to hear the belief about their soul catching too🙂Sad we can only see sparrows in the photographs.

21/03/23, 6:41 am - Dr Raguram: ‘Poetry is painting that speaks,’ Plutarch observed.
Throughout history, poets have painted their canvas with lyrical and idyllic verses.
The landscape of poetry in India is vibrant and multihued and there is a treasure trove waiting to be unearthed across languages.
On this World Poetry Day, let me share a poem by Malathi Maithri which has been translated from Tamil by Lakshmi Holmstrom.
OBSERVE THE CRANE
The crane waits
at the verge of the river-bed,
fish swimming in its memory.
In search of its reflection, the moon
wanders, vanishes.
Swirls of roots tear into the earth,
with hunger.
The wind, sweeping up its troubles,
hurls the heat in all directions.
Pulverized, the heart swirls
like dust in a storm.
It is not just the earth
that overflows through its cracks
in heat and rage.
The crane
absorbs into itself all that heat
and boils within.
If only the crane would sink into
the water swirling in its memory
and beat its wings,
the river might gather its form once more
from the scattered drops,
and walk again.
River, watch.

23/03/23, 6:23 am - Dr Raguram: The World Poetry Day yesterday was also the birthday of a poet whom I admire deeply, Billy Collins.
He was the Poet Laureate of US and was instrumental in setting up a very interesting program, ‘Poetry 180’ for high schools. He chose 180 poems for the program which are available online and are worth a look: https://www.loc.gov/programs/poetry-and-literature/poet-laureate/poet-laureate-projects/poetry-180/all-poems/
John Constable who described himself as, “I am man of the clouds” assiduously captured nature’s most ephemeral occurrence, clouds, in over fifty paintings. These are some of the most magnificent images of clouds ever painted. In this poem, Student of Clouds, Billy Collins reflects on Constable’s cloud paintings and populates the canvas with his beautiful words. 
The emotion is to be found in the clouds,
not in the green solids of the sloping hills
or even in the gray signatures of rivers,
according to Constable, who was a student of clouds
and filled shelves of sketchbooks with their motion,
their lofty gesturing and sudden implication of weather.
Outdoors, he must have looked up thousands of times,
his pencil trying to keep pace with their high voyaging
and the silent commotion of their eddying and flow.
Clouds would move beyond the outlines he would draw
as they moved within themselves, tumbling into their centers
and swirling off at the burning edges in vapors
to dissipate into the universal blue of the sky.
In photographs we can stop all this movement now
long enough to tag them with their Latin names.
Cirrus, nimbus, stratocumulus
dizzying, romantic, authoritarian
they bear their titles over the schoolhouses below
where their shapes and meanings are memorized.
High on the soft blue canvases of Constable
they are stuck in pigment but his clouds appear
to be moving still in the wind of his brush
inching out of England and the nineteenth century
and sailing over these meadows where I am walking,
bareheaded beneath this cupola of motion,
my thoughts arranged like paint on a high blue ceiling.

30/03/23, 7:33 am - Dr Raguram: On the occasion of Sri Rama Navami let me offer you some glimpses from the Ramayana at the Amruteshwara temple in Amruthapura in Chikmagalur district. It is a small yet beautiful 12th century temple built by Amruteshwara Dandanayaka, during the reign of King Hoysala Veera Ballala II. On the south side of the parapet wall, the story of Ramayana is depicted in over seventy small panels. 
This series of panels depict an episode from Kishkinda kandam which is the fourth book and one of the seven kandams in Valmiki's Ramayana. After Shabari tells Rama about Sugreeva, Rama goes in search of him and reaches Rishimukha mountain. Seeing Rama and Lakshmana, Sugreeva feels uneasy and wonders whether they were sent by Vali and asks Hanuman to meet them (Panel 1). Reassured that Rama and Lakshmana poses no danger, Sugreeva accompanies Hanuman and meets them. After listening to them, Rama promises Sugreeva that the wrong done to him would be redressed and that he would be reinstated as the king of the Vanaras (Panel 2). To imbue confidence in Sugreeva, Rama hurls his arrow which penetrates seven sala trees as well as the subterranean places of earth and returns to his quiver (Panel 3). Overcome with the immense prowess of Rama, Sugreeva submits himself to Rama, who urges him to challenge Vali for a duel. In their first encounter, Rama is unable to distinguish between the two and asks Sugreeva to wear a garland the next time, so that he could identify Vali. Rama then kills Vali (Panel 4). Rama reinstates Sugreeva on the throne as the king of Kishhkinda (Panel 5). Since the panels are quite small, zoom in to see the details!
Stories from Ramayana are an integral part of various art forms in India, whether it is music, dance or folktales. In Amruteshwara temple stories of Ramayana are imbedded in its architectural style. These intricately carved panels are like unfolding narratives which are sequentially depicted like chapters in a book before the advent of paper and print!
If you travel to Hampi, you can see a craggy hill on the south bank of the river Tungabadra, which is believed to be the Rishimukha Parvata where Hanuman is reported to have met Rama and Lakshmana.
30/03/23, 10:55 pm - Nalini N R: Thank you Sir for the repeat but with ornately carved sculpture 👌I read small portions of Ramayana every Tuesday and completed Sundara kanda today being Rama Navami🙏

31/03/23, 6:33 am - Dr Raguram: Vincent van Gogh whose birthday was yesterday, was admitted into the asylum at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence which was once a monastery. It originally held many patients, but by the time he was admitted, the male wing was almost empty and he was also given an extra room to use as a studio. This is the painting of the studio by van Gogh where he produced over 140 of his works, including the iconic "Starry Night".  He also painted the view from his window, including the rolling hills 21 times but none of them show the bars on the window of his room! In a letter to his brother Theo, he wrote, "Through the iron-barred window I can make out a square of wheat in an enclosure, above which in the morning I see the sunrise in its glory."
01/04/23, 8:03 am - Dr Raguram: I have been listening to piano concertos of late and have been besotted with Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No 2. It unfolds effortlessly and one is drawn deeply into its fluid, melodic notes. Rhythmic tones from the piano seamlessly and subtly flow into the orchestra. The momentum builds up with several delicate touches. It is full of emotional intensity and has a hypnotic effect on me. 
I started reading about Rachmaninoff (whose birthday is today) and found that he was mentored by none other than Tchaikovsky.  After Tchaikovsky’s untimely death, Rachmaninoff faced a setback in his career.  His first major work Piano Concerto 1 was savagely criticized and he went to meet Tolstoy for some succour. To his great dismay he found Tolstoy to be emotionally distant and dismissive of his work. In throes of deep depression, he sought the help of Dr Nikolai Dahl, an internist in neurology who had a deep interest in Jean-Martin Charcot’s work with hypnosis and was using it in therapy.  After several months of therapy, Rachmaninoff recovered his creative urge and composed Piano Concerto 2, which he dedicated to Dr Nikolai Dah. Full of passion, melancholy, yearning, and ultimately triumph, it remains till today as one of the most influential classical works.
In his own words, “Music is enough for a whole lifetime, but a lifetime is not enough for music.”

02/04/23, 11:32 am - Dr Raguram: There is an interesting sculpture of Hans Christian Andersen in Central Park, New York. It depicts the author of Ugly Duckling, reading a book with a duckling at his feet. Quite often, children climb on top of him and sit on his lap! Countless generations of children (and adults alike!) have grown up relishing his fairy tales. The Danish word for fairy tale is Eventyr and Hans Christian Anderson authored hundreds of them which continue have a universal appeal. He is the eighth most-translated writer in the world, trailing right behind Vladimir Lenin and his works have been translated in more than 125 languages. 
Raised in poverty and having lost his father early in life, he had to work in a factory as a child to support his mother. He endured many hardships and suffered from countless fears and phobias.  His greatest fear was one of being buried alive, something which disturbed him so much that he made a note every night before bed to alert anyone who found him that he was merely sleeping and not dead. In spite of all the adversities in his life, he was able to transform his pain into art and as he reflected: "Most of what I have written is a reflection of myself. Every character is from life. I know and have known them all" 
Hans Christian Andersen (whose birthday is today) was much more than a children’s writer and multiple layers of meanings are embedded in his stories. He founded a genre that has a unique and enduring appeal.
02/04/23, 9:01 pm - Nalini N R: Once again, a blessed person who could translate his pain which I think was therapeutic. Nice to remember such great personalities through you Sir!

04/04/23, 9:44 am - Dr Raguram: On the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti, let us recollect and embrace these words from the Uttaradhyayan Sutra which is revered as Bhagwan Mahavira's last sermon.
I particularly like these words of His, 
“Just as a threaded (sasutra) needle is secure from being lost,
in the same way a person given to self-study (sasutra) cannot be lost.”
(Uttaradhyayana, 29/59)

06/04/23, 10:44 am - Dr Raguram: “Lord Ram gave Hanuman a quizzical look and said, "What are you, a monkey or a man?" Hanuman bowed his head reverently, folded his hands and said, "When I do not know who I am, I serve You and when I do know who I am, You and I are One.”
― Tulsidas, Ramcharitmanas
Hundred pillar mandapam in Varadaraja Perumal Temple in Kanchipuram is a treasure trove. Each and every pillar is adorned with beautifully sculpted figures, like this one of Hanuman

07/04/23, 7:58 am - Dr Raguram: It was late afternoon and as we were cruising through the Death Valley, a congregation of dark clouds rolled in over the blue sky. The sun peeped through the grey clouds caressing the mountains with swirls of golden hues. It was as if the rays were destined to create a great work of art on nature’s easel which poets often excel in expressing in words. I was reminded of Wordsworth’s poem, “Composed Upon An Evening of Extraordinary Splendor and Beauty”. He describes the magical sight of the glowing evening:
No sound is uttered,--but a deep
And solemn harmony pervades
The hollow vale from steep to steep,
And penetrates the glades.
Far-distant images draw nigh,
Called forth by wondrous potency
Of beamy radiance, that imbues,
Whate'er it strikes, with gem-like hues!
In the preface to his 1800 collection of poems, “Lyrical Ballads,” he argued that men and women who live in close association with the natural environment are uniquely in tune with “the essential passions of the heart” because their very humanity is “incorporated with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature.” He also lamented that this relationship has frayed over time and wrote in “The World Is Too Much With Us,” 
The world is too much with us; late and soon,
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;—
Little we see in Nature that is ours;
We have given our hearts away..
Lines to ponder on Wordsworth’s 253rd birthday today!
07/04/23, 1:31 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. Such a short answer, a blend of devotion and self realization🙏
07/04/23, 1:49 pm - Nalini N R: Death Valley, what a name. But the way the colour is spread, very unusual effect. And so true that we are so far away from 'nature'. Ancient times even king's used to renounce everything and go into vanaprathashram so near to nature to understand themselves in that serene atmosphere!

08/04/23, 10:16 am - Dr Raguram: The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame (whose birthday is today), is an enchanting narrative woven around the adventures of four woodland animals, the Mole, the Water Rat, the Badger and an often mischievous Mr Toad. Though each of them is different from the other, the bond between them becomes stronger over time. It is an inventive, imaginative tale which can be read and interpreted at many levels. There is also a hidden subtext which conveys a moral or two, like the importance of fidelity, fortitude, being honest and the power of friendship. 
Beyond the idyllic tone of the book, there is a poignant tale. The Wind in the Willows evolved from the bedtime stories that Graham narrated to his son, Alastair. Alastair was born premature and was partially blind. Since he was small and squinty, he was nicknamed “Mouse” and had to endure ridicule and bullying all through his life which unfortunately did not end happily. One day at Oxford, where he was studying, he downed a glass of port and took a late night stroll. The next morning, his decapitated body was found on the railways tracks near the university. An inquest determined his death to be suicide but out of respect for his father, it was recorded as an accident. Grahame never recovered from the loss of his only child and became increasingly reclusive, eventually abandoning writing altogether.
The descriptions of nature in the book are truly wonderful. The narration is imbued with a love of nature with lyrical passages, like this one:
“When tired at last, he sat on the bank, while the river still chattered on to him, a babbling procession of the best stories in the world, sent from the heart of the earth to be told at last to the insatiable sea.”
Incidentally, Chapter 7, “The Piper at the Gates of Dawn”, is also the name of Pink Floyd’s first album in 1967.

09/04/23, 8:09 am - Dr Raguram: Easter commemorating the resurrection of Christ, was the earliest feast day decided upon by the ancient Christian church. One of the most beautiful depictions of Easter is by Raphael which he painted when he was just in his teens.
In this painting one can see Christ in the centre, hovering in the air above the tomb. Four guards are on either side with raised hands pointing out to him. In the left hand corner are Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome who are on the way to anoint Christ. Two angels flank Christ on either side with their hands raised in blessing. Interestingly there are two symbolic representations in the painting; snake referring to the Satan and white crane indicating its strength and endurance during migration.
George Herbert, one of the great devotional poets in English, wrote couple of poems on Easter. In one of them, Easter Wings, he wrote:
O let me rise
As larks, harmoniously,
And sing this day thy victories:
Then shall the fall further the flight in me.
The poet suggests that those who stay close to God through religious devotion can “fly" above, or find redemption from, their suffering.
Interestingly, he arranged these lines in print to resemble the shape of bird’s wings
09/04/23, 8:27 am - Nalini N R: A photograph or painting, simply enchanting. And what a tragedy. Sorrow deep within flows in the canvas of nature. And those lines.....
09/04/23, 8:36 am - Nalini N R: What a painting and concept. Thanks Sir for the narrative and the poem.

10/04/23, 7:25 am - Dr Raguram: Madness has engaged the attention of writers and thinkers for long and Kahlil Gibran (whose death anniversary is today) was no exception. “The Madman” was his first published work in English.  It is an innovative collection of over 30 parables and poems exploring what occurs once we strip away our masks to look within and bare ourselves to God. Gibran describes this state as one of both freedom and vulnerability. In his words, “I have found both freedom and safety in my madness; the freedom of loneliness and the safety from being understood, for those who understand us enslave something in us.”
Khalil Gibran continued this path of enquiry in his best remembered publication ‘The Prophet’. In this book, he reflects on subjects as varied as love, death, self-knowledge, joy and sorrow, reason and passion, in simple yet philosophical language. It has been translated into forty languages and has sold a million copies worldwide. “The Madman” continues to be read and cherished for its timeless understanding of our shared humanity.
Gibran, in his writings, has touched upon almost all the important areas of human life in relation to God, nature, and others, in an elegant, inspiring style.
Ultimately, Gibran’s poems urge the reader to contemplate and reflect on the profound truths of human existence. 
The imagery in these lines from his poem, ‘Out Of My Deeper Heart,’ is particularly stunning: 
Out of my deeper heart a bird rose and flew skyward.
Higher and higher did it rise,
yet larger and larger did it grow.
At first it was but like a swallow,
then a lark,
then an eagle,
then as vast as a spring cloud,
and then it filled the starry heavens.
Out of my heart a bird flew skyward.
And it waxed larger as it flew.
Yet it left not my heart.

11/04/23, 7:53 am - Dr Raguram: In 1791, Thomas Paine published a pamphlet, “Rights of Man”. His main thesis was that humans have inherent rights such as freedom of expression, religion and freedom from persecution, and these have to cherished and protected. He wrote, “Man did not enter into society to become worse than he was before, nor to have fewer rights than he had before, but to have those rights better secured.”  Among those who were inspired by these words was Jyotirao Phule (whose birthday is today). He was a person much ahead of his time and along with his wife Savitribai Phule, dedicated his life for the betterment of oppressed groups, including women and the marginalized castes. He fought against caste and gender hierarchy and the ideological and social structures that naturalises and perpetuates their discrimination. 
The contribution of the couple for the advancement of the underprivileged is truly remarkable. They set up the first orphanage and home for widows. They were pioneers of women’s education in India and started the first girls school in Bhidewada, Pune. It was the first step in the long list of initiatives they took for the empowerment of women. They set up a care center called ‘Balhatya Pratibandhak Griha,’ where widows and rape victims could deliver their children in a safe and secure environment. They also adopted a child who was born there. I particularly like his concept of Satyashodhak marriage system which is simple, inexpensive and shorn of religious rituals, much akin to Kuvempu’s Mantra Mangalya.
On this day, let us recollect and reaffirm these words of his , “There cannot be a ‘nation’ worth the name until and unless all the people of the land, such as Shudras and Ati-shudras, tribals and fishermen etc, become truly educated and are able to think independently for themselves and are uniformly unified and emotionally integrated.”
11/04/23, 11:07 pm - Nalini N R: Thank you Sir for opening our eyes and knowing about these great thinkers.
11/04/23, 11:14 pm - Nalini N R: Oh yes. We are blessed to have had such reformers and binding on our part to work on those lines.

12/04/23, 7:38 am - Dr Raguram: Driving along the Big Sur where the winding road hugs the edge of cliffs that drop into an indigo blue ocean, is an incredible experience. One of the most amazing views is from the spectacular Bixby bridge, which soars above the cavernous Bixby creek. Down below, a rustic cabin in the Bixby canyon was the setting of an unusual book, Big Sur, by Jack Kerouac (whose birthday is today.)  It is a biographical novel Kerouac wrote after the publication of ‘On the Road’, when he was battling alcoholism and extreme depression. There are many lyrical passages like this in the book:
“But I remember seeing a mess of leaves suddenly go skittering in the wind and into the creek, then floating rapidly down the creek towards the sea, making me feel a nameless horror even then of 'Oh my God, we're all being swept away to sea no matter what we know or say or do”
Jack Kerouac along with his friends William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg were considered to be part of the ‘Beat Generation’. Though the slang meaning of ‘beat’ is one of being ‘tired’, Kerouac gave a totally new interpretation and said that it is actually derived from the word ‘beatitude’, meaning ‘blessedness’, something Kerouac searched for in vain all through his troubled life: “Maybe that's what life is... a wink of the eye and winking stars.”

13/04/23, 8:12 am - Dr Raguram: Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar (whose birthday is tomorrow), was an amazing polymath. He was a politician, economist, anthropologist, jurist, theologian, historian, social reformer, lawyer, author, constitutionalist, sociologist, political scientist, feminist, environmentalist, educationist and a social scientist. This long list is a tribute to his thirst for knowledge across disciplines.
Ambedkar’s assiduous quest for equality, justice  and the welfare of every human being, lead him to Buddhism. On 14 October 1956, he converted to Buddhism, along with 3,65,000 of his followers in Nagpur. Unfortunately he died two months after the event on December 6, 1956, three days after completing his final manuscript, ‘The Buddha and His Dhamma’. He describes the appeal of Buddha quite eloquently: “All prophets have promised salvation. The Buddha is the one teacher who did not make any such promise. He made a sharp distinction between a moksha data (Giver of Salvation) and a marga data (Way Finder), one who gives salvation and one who only shows the way. He was only a marga data. Salvation must be sought by each for himself by his own effort.”  
Ambedkar continues to be the ‘marga data’ for millions of oppressed for whom equality, social justice and an egalitarian livelihood is still a distant dream, even decades after independence.
“Men are mortal. So are ideas. An idea needs as much propagation as a plant needs watering. Otherwise, both will wither and die.”
13/04/23, 11:10 pm - Nalini N R: The combination of hues makes me feel it is so unreal, different from what we usually come across in the case of sceneries where they naturally blend. But the photographs of death Valley appear like forced colour combination 🤔 And the caption written! It's like body which perishes and the vast space probably space that is Brahman which is eternal! Left to reader's interpretation🙂
13/04/23, 11:15 pm - Nalini N R: What a write up Sir. Yes he was a fantastic blend of everything a society badly needs. And his Gurus. What a selection. Very true, those who guided and propagated the highest values.

15/04/23, 7:07 am - Dr Raguram: A few years ago I got a book, the biography of Leonardo da Vinci by Walter Isaacson, as a gift. It is a magisterial account of the hugely talented, multitasker whose creative energy spanned many diverse domains. Leonardo (whose birthday is today), was a relentlessly curious observer of everything that was happening around him. In his words, there are three different kinds of people, “Those who see by themselves, those who see when someone has shown them and those who do not see.”  His inquisitive mind wanted to know what causes people to yawn, how they walk on ice, what makes the aortic valves close and how light is processed in the eye. He even came up with the first description of arteriosclerosis as an outcome of the ageing process through dissecting the body of a hundred-year-old man. He made it a habit to record all his observations in thousands of notebook pages, known as codices.
There are two things that are distinctive in birds; their ability to fly and their song. As a birder, I am amazed at Leonardo’s keen observations of the flight of birds, which he recorded in detail in the Codex on the Flight of Birds. He made detailed drawings of birds as they soared, turned and manoeuvred in the wind. He wrote, "When a bird with a wide wingspan and short tail wants to take off, it will lift its wings with force and turn them to receive the wind beneath them." He was the first to document flight manoeuvres now called dynamic soaring. Birds use these manoeuvres to extract energy from the gradient of wind velocity for sustained flight. Leonardo described both horizontal and upward dynamic soaring as well as upward soaring in updrafts through detailed sketches. His description pre-dates by almost 400 years the first generally accepted explanation of the soaring technique by Lord Rayleigh in 1883. 
No other figure in history was as creative in so many diverse fields as Leonardo. As Isaacson commented, “His genius was of the type we can understand, even take lessons from. It was based on skills we can aspire to improve in ourselves, such as curiosity and intense observation. He had an imagination so excitable that it flirted with the edges of fantasy, which is also something we can try to preserve in ourselves and indulge in our children.”
Leonardo was a lifelong learner. In his words, “The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding.”
15/04/23, 8:08 pm - Nalini N R: Thank you Sir for the fantastic details of one of my favorites. His basic intellectual potential and creativity, and God given gift to use all parts of his brain. Simply superb.
16/04/23, 8:42 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
16/04/23, 8:42 am - Dr Raguram: I had posted about Leonardo da Vinci on his birthday, yesterday. The day is also celebrated as World Art Day to draw attention to the contribution of artists and to recognize profound importance of arts in enriching our lives. Art encompasses painting, sculpture, dance, theatre and film among others.
Whenever I visit a temple in India, I am astounded by the sheer ingenuity and skill of artists who embellish its precincts but remain largely unknown.
For example, this suavely sculpted figure brimming with exuberance is from the Chennakeshava temple at Belur, Karnataka. Replete with intricate and opulent ornamentation, it portrays a beautiful, dextrously balanced, dancing woman. There is an interesting element in this aestheticized, graceful sculpture. When a drop of water is made to fall from the tip of her right hand above the head, it would pass through her nose, her left breast, the tip of her left hand and finally reach the toe of her left leg! It is truly an epitome of perfection.
As I kept looking at the sculpture, I was fascinated with the inventiveness and imaginative creativity of the artist who chiselled a block of stone and brought it alive.
Ephemeral beauty
Emanates from stone
And melts into a sculpture
16/04/23, 10:33 pm - Nalini N R: It is simply gorgeous Sir. Not only the woman but the creeper which surrounds her and the tiny men down playing drums and flute👌

17/04/23, 8:22 am - Dr Raguram: Years ago, our friend Dr Stuart Schwartz, gave us a book, ‘I Am That’ by Nisargadatta Maharaj and mentioned as to how deeply it influenced his spiritual quest. It is not a book in the conventional format and is an account of Maharaj’s dialogues with seekers. The book is arranged in a question and answer format and covers many topics such as god, the ego, living in the world, free will. I have been dipping into this interesting book on and off, over the years.  Often I start with chapter ‘Awareness is Free’ and then onto chapters which focus on his spiritual experiences. He speaks consistently on the direct experience of "I am". 
In the sixth chapter of the “Chandogya Upanishad,” the 24-year old Shvetaketu returns home, 12 years after his father has sent him to study the vedas. The first question that Svetaketu’s father Uddalaka Aruni asks his son is whether he has returned with the knowledge of that by which “we perceive what cannot be perceived, we know what cannot be known.” Svetaketu answers in the negative, asking his father what that actually is. His father explains, using the famous Advaita precept: ‘tat tvam asi’. Maharaj delves on this and expands this concept through dialogue with the seekers.  There is so much similarity between his teachings and that of Ramana Maharishi. 
The book is studded with poetic descriptions. On Nisargatta Maharaj’s birthday today, let me recall some of his observations: 
"My teacher told me to hold onto the sense ‘I am’ tenaciously and not to swerve from it even for a moment. I did my best to follow his advice and in a comparatively short time I realized within myself the truth of his teaching. In the stillness of the mind I saw myself as I am un- bound." 
“Give up all questions except one, "Who am I?" After all the only fact you are sure of is that you "are". The "I am" is certain, the "I am this" is not. Struggle to find out what you are in reality.”
Among many of his comments, one that deeply resonates within me is in this attached photograph of mine!

18/04/23, 9:17 am - Dr Raguram: April 18 is celebrated as World Heritage Day, also known as the International Day for Monuments and Sites. It is dedicated to highlighting the importance of cultural heritage and raising awareness about the need to preserve historical sites and monuments.
On this day, let me draw attention to Vaikuntha Perumal Kovil, one of the most unique temples which is visited by very few, in Kanchipuram. When we stepped into its precincts on a cold morning, we found the whole temple shorn of any visitor, which gave us ample opportunity to savour its architectural legacy at leisure. The priest in the main sanctum informed us that the main temple consists of three floors, each one with Vishnu murtis in different poses; sitting, sleeping, and standing. Unfortunately, it is difficult to access the top two floors. The priest also mentioned that there was a secret underground tunnel from this temple all the way to Mahabalipuram!
A distinctive aspect of the temple is the pillared corridor surrounding the sanctum. The walls of corridors are embellished with stories, carved into them. Many of the panels have eroded with time and it can be difficult to identify them. Thankfully, before visiting the place, I had downloaded a scholarly and informative monograph about it, authored by Dr Minakshi in 1936. Interestingly, many of the bas reliefs trace the life and history of Nandivarman II, who built the temple. There are vivid depictions of battle scenes with elephants and soldiers, much like scenes of warfare depicted on the outer walls of the Bayon temple, which was built five centuries later in Siem Reap, Cambodia. I understand that the chronological, historical, narrative depictions in bas reliefs in Vaikuntha Perumal shrine is the first such attempt in temple architecture in India. In front of the sculpted walls there is an array of beautifully chiselled pillars in the shape of sitting lions.
Vaikuntha Perumal Temple is also referred to as Parameswaravinnagaram. Nandivarman II’s original name before his coronation was Parameswara and he named this temple after himself. It is the 56th Divya Desam dedicated to Lord Vishnu. There is a small shrine dedicated to the famous saint poet, Thirumangai Alwar, who wrote hymns in praise of the Lord and the king who built it. In one of the hymns he wrote:
உரந்தரு மெல்லணைப் பள்ளி கொண்டான் ஒரு கால் முன்னம் மா வுருவாய்க் கடலுள்
வரந்தரு மா மணி வண்ணனிடம் மணி மாடங்கள் சூழ்ந்து அழகாய கச்சி
நிரந்தவர் மண்ணையில் புண்ணுகர் வேல் நெடு வாயிலுகச் செருவில் முன நாள்
பரந்தவன் பல்லவர் கோன் பணிந்த பரமேச்சுவர விண்ணகரம் அதுவே-
In essence, the hymn states that Parameswaravinnagaram, the abode of the Lord is surrounded by mansions filled with precious gems and is in the capital of the beautiful Kanchipuram where the Pallava king who won many a battle and destroyed enemies, surrendered to the Lord.
Temples are not merely places of worship in India. Steeped in history, they are also sites of dazzling expressions of elegant art and architecture, which need to be cherished and conserved.

19/04/23, 8:48 am - Dr Raguram: Poetry has touched the lives of countless people throughout history. James Gates Percival once commented that “The world is full of poetry. The air is living with its spirit; and the waves dance to the music of its melodies, and sparkle in its brightness.” Poetry And The Creative Mind Day which is observed today draws attention to the creative minds of poets and their art. The magic is in poetry’s ability to be intensely personal, yet unfathomably imaginative at the same time, like this one by Srilata.
LINES OF POETRY
Lines of poetry
break 
like sudden light
on a black-winged crow,
descend 
like song birds
on bare trees,
arrange themselves
in so many
whimsical spines,
word by fast flying word,
light
with meaning,
new 
like unseasonable rain.
19/04/23, 2:09 pm - Nalini N R: Yes. I have read some clips about his teachings. All great saints of our India have said the same ultimate being non-dualism, this itself being the road. Thank you Sir for the quote and the photograph.
19/04/23, 2:14 pm - Nalini N R: Wonderful Sir. One of the alwars who showed Bhakti is a path to attain the Jnana of Brahman.

21/04/23, 9:26 am - Dr Raguram: John Muir, whose birthday is today, was legendary naturalist and conservationist. He often spent months on end hiking in the Sierra Nevada, detailing his observations in journals and through books, letters, and poems. In 1868, Muir visited Yosemite for the first time and was overwhelmed and enthralled by the beauty he saw before him. “We are now in the mountains and they are in us, kindling enthusiasm, making every nerve quiver, filling every pore and cell of us,” he wrote. He initiated measures to protect Yosemite from being threatened by commercial developments. After several legal battles, Congress established Yosemite National Park in 1890 in order to conserve thousands of acres of forest land from further destruction. 
Yosemite is a magical place, with cascading waterfalls and soaring mountain peaks. It is a fascinating experience, especially, to have a glimpse of the iconic Half Dome.
There is an interesting story about it:
The Legend Of Tis-sa-ack:
Once an old Indian woman Tis-sa-ack and her husband arrived at the Yosemite Valley which they knew as Ahwahnee. The woman was carrying a heavy, cone shaped basket that was woven from reeds and the course grasses. Her husband walked alongside her unburdened except for his walking stick. It was a hot day and as the old couple continued on their journey they grew more and more thirsty. Tis-sa-ack arrived at the beautiful mountain lake first and she drank so deeply that when her husband arrived the lake was dry. Because the lake was dry there came a drought and the once beautiful green valley dried up. The man was enraged by this and he raised his walking stick to strike at his wife. She cried as she ran from him and her tears stained her face. She turned and threw her basket at her husband….and as they faced one another The Great Spirit transformed them both to great stone structures. She and her husband now remain separated forever, as Half dome and Washington Column. To this day, her tears stain the face of the Half Dome. 
As John Muir observed, “In every walk with Nature one receives far more than he seeks.”
21/04/23, 11:15 pm - Nalini N R: Earth is preserved by such great people whether it is west or east. Or else this planet wouldn't have survived this long. Future no idea with this terrible climate change thanks for the selfish, narrow minded people. Thank you Sir, can go to bed with gratitude.

22/04/23, 8:00 am - Dr Raguram: Today is Akshaya Tritiya, a day when people throng the jewellery shops to buy gold. The word ‘Akshaya’ means ‘never diminishing’ and hence the belief that buying the precious metal on this day guarantees endless wealth.
Like many festivals in India, Akshaya Tritiya has several legends connected with it. It is an important day in Jainism and is associated with Adinatha, the first of the 24 Tirthankaras.  Rishabadeva, king of Ayodhya gave up all earthly pleasures (much like Gautam Buddha), to lead the life of a monk as Adinatha. In order to live as a Jain monk, one must not possess anything, not even a morsel of food. When he started begging for food, his subjects offered him their most prized possessions like precious stones, elephants, horses but not food or drink which they thought was too modest an offering for their dear king. The king refused all the fine gifts and went without food and water until, finally, his grandson Shreyansha Kumara understood his need and offered him some sugarcane juice. With this juice, Adinatha broke his fast that had lasted 400 days. 
It was on Akshaya Tritiya day that Adinatha broke his fast. As a mark of reverence to Lord Adinatha and his strict penance, Jains celebrate this day as “Parna Diwas” after the penance of Varshi Tap and end their year-long alternative-day fasting with sugarcane juice.  
This photograph is from Cave 4 at Badamai. Carved into its wall is a beautiful, life-size relief of Adinatha. He is standing in Kayotsarga pose, with unbent knees and straight arms, which are held at the side and do not touch the body. It is representative of an ascetic practice characterised by detachment of the physical body. Adinatha has locks of hair cascading down his shoulders and this is one of the ways to identify his sculpture. There is an interesting story behind this. When he chose to become an ascetic, Rishbadeva started pulling out his long strands of hair. After four fistfuls, when he was pulling out the fifth fistful of hair Indra is said to have told him, " This strand of hair on the crown of your head and hanging down over your shoulders looks attractive. Kindly leave it as it is." Rishabadeva agreed. Due to this bunch of hair he got the popular name; Keshariya ji (one with hair). 
As for myself, I am a miner for gold…in the hearts of people
22/04/23, 9:19 am - Nalini N R: What I have been fed with is a thirst for wealth which is so impermanent. The Jain side of the significance of the day is really nice. Thank you Sir for the information.

25/04/23, 7:41 am - Dr Raguram: All forms of aesthetic expression, including poetry, spring from the deepest, personal, inner self. It is essentially an adventure in selfhood. That said, we are living in an era in which selfhood has become fluid. The boundary between the ‘real self’ and the ‘imagined, virtual self’ has become rather porous in the cyber world in which we are increasingly immersed in. 
Poet, novelist, Robert Penn Warren, whose birthday was yesterday, observed presciently years ago that, “The ideal of understanding men and telling their story, noble or victorious, will be replaced by the study of statistics or non-ideographic units of an infinite series, and computers will dictate how such unites, which do breathe and move, can best be manipulated for their own good….the self we have is more and more a fictive self.” He observed that poetry has an important role in the integration of self, “in the face of increasingly disintegrative forces in our society, poetry may affirm and reinforce the notion of the self”.  He argued for “the creation of a new body of attitudes and values, a new assessment of our expanding technological capacities in relation to the context of nature”. He wrote very few nature poems and his “Evening Hawk”, is truly exceptional. He wrote:
From plane of light to plane, wings dipping through
Geometries and orchids that the sunset builds,
Out of the peak's black angularity of shadow, riding
The last tumultuous avalanche of
Light above pines and the guttural gorge,
The hawk comes.
His wing
Scythes down another day, his motion
Is that of the honed steel-edge, we hear
The crashless fall of stalks of Time.
The head of each stalk is heavy with the gold of our error.
Look! Look! he is climbing the last light
Who knows neither Time nor error, and under
Whose eye, unforgiving, the world, unforgiven, swings
Into shadow.
Long now,
The last thrush is still, the last bat
Now cruises in his sharp hieroglyphics. His wisdom
Is ancient, too, and immense. The star
Is steady, like Plato, over the mountain.
If there were no wind we might, we think, hear
The earth grind on its axis, or history
Drip in darkness like a leaking pipe in the cellar.
The poem is laden with rich metaphors, but personally I feel that no one has described the flight of a bird of prey in these exquisitely inventive words, “Now cruises in his sharp hieroglyphics”!
25/04/23, 11:11 pm - Nalini N R: We are becoming a slave of our own creation. Wonderful poem Sir but have to accept that I need to understand🤔
26/04/23, 8:37 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
26/04/23, 8:37 am - Dr Raguram: In 1836, Ralph Waldo Emerson (whose birthday is today) wrote an essay titled, "Nature". In it he recounted a mystical experience that he had while walking through the woods one afternoon. He experienced a deep kinship and communion with nature and wrote: “Standing on the bare ground, my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space, all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eyeball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle of God.”  For him nature is a spiritual experience that can be perceived intuitively. He observed, “This transcendental experience is open to each one of us. It only requires that we spend time contemplating its meaning and significance in our lives”.
Emerson, along with Henry David Thoreau, belonged to the Transcendentalist movement which emphasized the need for an intuitive and ‘poetic’ engagement with nature. In his words, “In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real sorrows. Nature says, he is my creature, and maugre all his impertinent griefs, he shall be glad with me”. 
Emerson lead a very productive life and lived till 79. Travails of ageing and the prospects of end of life, did not deter him from penning these moving lines in his poem ‘Terminus’
As the bird trims her to the gale,
I trim myself to the storm of time,
I man the rudder, reef the sail,
Obey the voice at eve obeyed at prime:
“Lowly faithful, banish fear,
Right onward drive unharmed;
The port, well worth the cruise, is near,
And every wave is charmed.”
26/04/23, 11:18 pm - Nalini N R: Wonderful photograph Sir with those clouds which constantly change their hues and shape and the waters! And the words of Emerson. In tune with nature definitely helps us sync with the eternal, but we pretend to be busy and spare no time to dwell.

29/04/23, 6:50 am - Dr Raguram: On the occasion of the World Sculpture Day, it is important to recognize that the sculptural tradition in India is the oldest in the world. It dates back to the Indus Valley civilization, where people made statues and figurines in terracotta and bronze. The iconic ‘Dancing Girl’ which was cast in bronze is a stellar example of their skill. This tradition has been kept alive throughout history all across the country, especially in places of worship. Intricate sculptures of gods and goddesses with scenes from mythology adorn almost every temple. Wide range of sculptural idioms flourished under the patronage of rulers. A compelling aesthetic sensibility imbued with unsurpassed technical brilliance radiates from many of these sculptures. 
Incidentally today is also World Dance Day. The art of dance in India has always been intertwined with sculpture. In Chidambaram, the abode of the celestial dancer, the walls of passageway in all four gopurams are decorated with exquisite representation of 108 karanas. In Natya Shastra, Bharata Muni defines a Karana as: ‘Hastapaada Samaayogah Nrittasya Karanam bhavet’. Each Karana is a combination of a specific movement of the legs (Charis) and hands (Nritta Hastas) performed in a particular posture (Sthana). These carvings provide us with tantalizing glimpses into the hoary sculptural legacy of our country. 
Looking at awe inspiring sculptures like this, I often struggle to express my emotional experience in words. It is an amazing, inexpressible feeling. That said, it is painful to see the abysmal way in which many of these artistic treasures are maintained in many. The sculptural legacy of our nation is a vital part of our identity and each and every one of us has a responsibility to protect, nurture, and conserve these valuable repositories of our rich cultural heritage. 
Our future lies in preserving our past…
30/04/23, 10:22 pm - Nalini N R: What a fantastic representation of different poses of Bharathanatyam!! We have ceased to appreciate these but people are getting hooked on to movies that too senseless. How the present generation is introduced to these and they have the sense to preserve is a question.

01/05/23, 9:00 am - Dr Raguram: The purpose of celebrating May Day is to recognize and honour the enormous contributions made by the working class and inform them of their rights, to protect them against exploitation. 
During the Industrial Revolution of the 1800s, the United States experienced great turmoil in the labour sector. There were very few protections in place for workers, so many men, women, and children worked long hours, doing excruciating labour, causing many to die. This unrest came to a head on May 1, 1886, as more than 300,000 workers walked out in protest of poor working conditions and in support of an eight-hour work day in the United States. This labour strike marked May 1 as International Workers’ Day as well. It started the eight hour movement, promoting a schedule of eight hours for labour, eight hours for recreation, and eight hours for rest.
The first May Day celebrations took place on May 1st 1890 after its proclamation by the first international congress of socialist parties in Europe on July 14th 1889 in Paris, France, to dedicate May 1 every year as the "Workers Day of International Unity and Solidarity."
In India, the first May Day was celebrated on May 1, 1923, in Madras. It was organised by the Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan. It was during this day, the prominent Communist leader Malayapuram Singaravelu Chettiar hoisted the red flag in Chennai. 
Over the years, we are witnessing increasing internal migration of people in search of work, wherever they can find one. They play a pivotal role in our country. Living away from home is never easy. Many of them work without any contract without regular, assured pay. Nor does this section receive any meaningful help from the state. 
On this May Day, let us strive to strengthen their invisible hands…
(This panel from the Bayon temple, Krong Siem Reap, Cambodia depicts a group of workers actively engaged in their task)

05/05/23, 8:05 am - Dr Raguram: On the occasion of Buddha Purnima, let me dwell on the only sermon given by Buddha, in which he didn’t utter a single word. When he held up a flower, the whole congregation was silent, not understanding it’s significance, except one. Mahakasyapa looked at it intently and smiled. Buddha handed over the flower to him and said, “I have said what can be said and what cannot be said.” From that day Mahakasyapa became his successor.
In this ‘Flower Sermon’, Buddha drew our attention to the importance of direct experience, shorn of intellectual analysis. Flowers embody both form and formlessness. They arise from the earth and return to it, drawing attention to the formless consciousness of Oneness.
The simple act of seeing a flower can usher in a meditative state of intense awareness 
William Blake said it wonderfully:
To see a World in a Grain of Sand
And Heaven in a Wild Flower
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand
And eternity in an hour

07/05/23, 8:43 am - Dr Raguram: ‘The Gardener’ is a beautiful poem of Tagore. When I was re-reading it today, on his birthday, I particularly adored these lines from its final stanza:
“Who are you, reader, reading my poems a hundred years hence?
I cannot send you one single flower from this wealth of the spring, one single streak of gold from yonder clouds.
Open your doors and look abroad.
From your blossoming garden gather fragrant memories of the vanished flowers of an hundred years before.
In the joy of your heart may you feel the living joy that sang one spring morning, sending its glad voice across an hundred years.”
07/05/23, 8:58 pm - Nalini N R: Fantastic photograph Sir and the lines selected very apt. Words are not mere words, one can really experience what they say...

08/05/23, 6:07 am - Dr Raguram: Many a time in our lives, invariably we will find ourselves alone. These states differ from being lonely. Alone is a way of being-in- the -world, whereas loneliness is tinged with feelings of abandonment. Solitude is the state of being alone without feeling lonely. As May Sarton commented, “Loneliness is the poverty of self; solitude is richness of self.” It is a positive and constructive state of engagement with oneself. 
As I was strolling in the temple precincts at Avani, this particular sculpture caught my attention. It portrayed a man in silent repose. There was a sense of inexplicable inner peacefulness stemming from it.  Watching it, I was reminded of the words of Swami Chinmayananda, whose birthday is today, “There is no companion like solitude. One who knows how to tune himself to the inner silence, even in the midst of the din and roar of the marketplace, enjoys a most recreative solitude.”
As Lord Byron wrote, “There is a rapture on the lonely shore”.

12/05/23, 2:45 pm - Dr Raguram: At 40, Franz Kafka (1883-1924), who never married and had no children, was walking through a park one day in Berlin when he met a girl who was crying because she had lost her favourite doll. She and Kafka searched for the doll unsuccessfully.
Kafka told her to meet him there the next day and they would come back to look for her.
The next day, when they had not yet found the doll, Kafka gave the girl a letter "written" by the doll saying "please don't cry. I took a trip to see the world. I will write to you about my adventures."
Thus began a story which continued until the end of Kafka's life.
During their meetings, Kafka read the letters of the doll carefully written with adventures and conversations that the girl found adorable.
Finally, Kafka brought back the doll (he bought one) that had returned to Berlin.
"It doesn't look like my doll at all," said the girl.
Kafka handed her another letter in which the doll wrote: "my travels have changed me." The little girl hugged the new doll and brought the doll with her to her happy home.
A year later Kafka died.
Many years later, the now-adult girl found a letter inside the doll. In the tiny letter signed by Kafka it was written:
"Everything you love will probably be lost, but in the end, love will return in another way."
Embrace change. It's inevitable for growth. Together we can shift pain into wonder and love, but it is up to us to consciously and intentionally create that connection.
12/05/23, 10:59 pm - Nalini N R: A very apt narration Sir. Time should heal the loss and pave way for higher thinking. That's life.

Visiting it is like travel through time as it replete with wonderful collection of medieval art. The artworks are so beautiful and mesmerizing and are an enduring testimony to the skill of the medieval artists’ skills.  
On the Mother’s Day, let me share a beautiful sculpture which caught my attention as I was strolling through the museum. It was a life size, immaculately detailed wooden sculpture of Anne on the birthing bed with her child Mary, dating back to 1480. The legends state that Anne was married to Joachim and they shared a devout life at Nazareth. Anne was deeply grieved by her barrenness and promised God that she would dedicate her firstborn child to the Lord’s service. The couple then received a vision of the angel, who announced that Anne would conceive and bear a most wondrous child, Mary. 
St. Anne is considered the patron saint of mothers and also of women in labour.
14/05/23, 10:44 pm - Nalini N R: Wonderful wooden sculpture Sir. A close look at the figure, faces of mother and baby look so real. Mother's face is so calm, satisfied and the gesture of her hand...and the smiling baby.

17/05/23, 7:41 am - Dr Raguram: Today is the birthday of Edward Jenner, the father of vaccination. It is a curious fact of history that he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society, not for his path breaking work with vaccination, but for his observation about the nesting habits of the cuckoo. The nesting habits of the cuckoo had intrigued philosophers and naturalists since the days of Aristotle. It was known that the cuckoo parasites on other species of birds and lays a single egg in the nest of a bird of another species. The foster-parents then feed and raise the young cuckoo as if it were their own. Only the young cuckoo survives.  All eggs and fledglings belonging to the birds that built the nest disappear. Jenner determined to find out why only the cuckoo survives in each nest. He noticed that it was not the parent cuckoo that ejected the foster parents' eggs and chicks from the nest, as was previously believed, but the newly hatched cuckoo!  In its first few days of life the fledgling bird worked its way backwards, up the side of the nest, pushing behind it an egg or young bird, until this could be thrown from the nest.  It repeated this task until only it remained in the nest. Consequently, it took over the food supply provided tirelessly by the foster parents. Edward Jenner made several observations and experiments to support his hypothesis. His findings remained contentious until the naturalists were able to photograph the phenomenon.
Common hawk cuckoo, like many other cuckoos, is a brood parasite, preferring to lay the egg in the nest of jungle babblers. A single blue egg is laid in the nest. Once the egg is hatched, the hatchling usually evicts the eggs of its host and is reared to maturity by foster parents, much like what Jenner had observed. But it was also noticed that sometimes, it may not always evict the host and that young birds may be seen along with young babblers. 
Shakespeare was an excellent observer of nature and gave vi. He mentions the cuckoo’s habit of laying its eggs in other birds’ nests, in both The Rape of Lucrece, where “Hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows nests” and in King Lear:
The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,
That it had its head bit off by its young
17/05/23, 10:49 pm - Nalini N R: Dark side of nature. Some humans may be a twisted version of hateful cuckoo🤔

21/05/23, 8:38 am - Dr Raguram: The lure to get the brain to reveal its secrets is irresistible! Amongst those who made significant inroads into unravelling its secrets was Hans Berger, discoverer of electroencephalogram (EEG), whose birthday is today. There is an interesting background to his inclination to uncover secrets of the brain. In 1893, when he was 19, he fell off his horse during and was nearly trampled. On that same day, his sister, far away, got a bad feeling about him and she sent a telegram to her father asking if everything was all right. Berger felt that he had transmitted his thoughts to his sister somehow and called it as a case of “spontaneous telepathy.” He strove to prove how telepathy worked, trying to measure mental activity through various means, but to no avail. He scrutinized blood flow and brain temperature before turning his attention to electrical output. His breakthrough finally came on July 6, 1924 when using a vacuum tube amplifier to enhance the electrical signals, he was finally able to spot a brain wave in a patient with skull injury. He took more than five years to report his findings in a complete form. 
Hans Berger’s discovery of electroencephalography was a milestone in the advancement of neuroscience. Unfortunately, he gained neither acceptance nor recognition among his fellow contemporaries and there was also an uneasy relationship with the Nazi regime. His life took a dark turn when he was ousted from his research position at the university and forced into a non-research job at a nursing home. Convinced that he had a fatal heart disease and in throes of depression, Berger ended his life by hanging in 1941. 
It is a daunting task for lonely pioneers who pursue their passion in the face of many obstacles. Often the inner loneliness and emotional turmoil is intricately interwoven with the creative impulse…

22/05/23, 10:21 am - Dr Raguram: Arthur Conan Doyle, whose birthday is today, graduated from the University of Edinburgh Medical School and special interest in ophthalmology. It was no wonder then, that the main character in his works, Sherlock Holmes, was a very keen observer. 
Careful attention to details is one of the important components of clinical medicine. Dr Shattner articulated the essential skills that a physician has to cultivate and summarized it in the acronym SOAPS:
S maintaining a Systematic approach
O using keen Observation
A Accessing relevant databases
P employing a Personal empathic attitude
S Shared decision-making
Sherlock Holmes’s famous deductions were based on his astute powers of observation. He often advised Watson that ‘It is a capital mistake to draw conclusions without data.’ He used to consult his meticulously compiled ‘Index’ and books from his library before arriving at conclusion. Though he is often portrayed as being detached, cold or remote, he was sensitive to his client’s circumstances and reached out to those in distress. All these form crucial components in clinical decision making. I often find myself quoting Holmes to my students to enhance their clinical acumen.
In the era of Evidence Based Medicine, we often rely on reliable sources of information to guide our clinical decisions. In the process, many a time we find ourselves bogged down in a morass of information. Unfortunately, we have to contend with limited storage space within ourselves. Arthur Conon Doyle employed an interesting metaphor ‘Brain Attic’, to highlight it. He wrote in the ‘ A Study At Scarlet’: 
“I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge, you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.” 
A timely advice in the digital era!

23/05/23, 8:57 am - Dr Raguram: Who can forget A Doll’s House? Henrik Ibsen (whose birthday is today) wrote the play in 1879. It was much ahead of its time in terms of challenging traditional gender roles in marriage. Nora, the heroine, has been a domesticated person all through her life, striving to do the best for her family. She gets tangled in messy circumstances because of the money she borrowed from a man of ill repute for her husband. Both the men try to control and manipulate her in their own ways. Fed up with all this, she starts questioning the foundation of everything that she believed in. Feeling betrayed and disillusioned that she has always been treated like a doll in her life, she decides to leave. Her husband strongly criticizes her move, saying that by deserting her husband and children she is forsaking her "most sacred duties". Nora tells him that the duties that are most sacred to her now are the "duties to herself". The play ends with her exit as she walks out slamming the door.  It is an act of bold self-assertion. “I must stand quite alone,” Nora declares, “if I am to understand myself and everything about me.” After playing the role of a doll, Nora begins the journey of self-discovery afresh.
Through this ending, Ibsen is fundamentally questioning the institution of marriage, gender and societal roles of women in an "exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint." 
Nora's journey keeps continuing all around us.. 
While primarily known for his dramatic works he also wrote poems and he was described as a ‘profound poetic dramatist’. Snippets from one his poem, 
WITH A WATER LILY
Tis the flower with the white wings.
Buoyed upon the quiet stream
In the spring it lay adream.

24/05/23, 8:37 am - Dr Raguram: World Turtle Day is an annual event (that was celebrated yesterday) aimed at increasing public awareness about the important need to protect the shrinking habitats of turtle and tortoises. 
Hindu mythology is replete with references to animals, including tortoise. Prominent among them is the churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthan), which appears in several texts such as the Mahabharata, Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana. To churn the primordial ocean, Mount Mandara was used as a churning rod and the snake, Vasuki as the churning rope. The Asuras held the head of the snake and the Devas held its tail and they pulled his body alternately, causing the mountain to rotate and the ocean to churn. In the process, slowly Mount Mandara began to sink.  Vishnu, in his second avatar as the tortoise Kurma, came to the rescue and supported the mountain on his shell. Without Kurma avatar it would not have been possible for the ocean to be churned and the devas would not have received the fourteen gifts. The churning also resulted in the poison, ‘halahala’, which was imbibed by Lord Shiva to protect the universe from destruction. 
The tortoise, as a symbol of the earth also figures in several vedic and puranic texts. According to these representation, the tortoise’s domed shell is heaven and the flat underside is the earth. Further, the kurmanivesha (tortoise abode) is central to Hindu astrology, wherein the body of the tortoise would be divided up into nakshatras (constellations) that influenced the regions occupying a certain body part. For instance, the head often represented the eastern region of the earth. 
Turtle is considered very lucky in astrology and it is believed that Goddess Lakshmi, showers blessings on those who wear the ‘turtle ring.’ 
There are three temples in India where Kurma is the main deity: Srikumaram near Srikakulam, Gavirangapura near Hosadurga and Kurma Varadaraja Swamy temple in Chittoor district. Prominent among them is Srikurmam, where the presiding Deity, Lord Kurma is self-manifest, or svayambhu. He is about 70 cm long, shaped like the shell of a turtle. The Deity’s tail is a saligram presented by Adi Sankara. In the temple’s premises, a tortoise park has also been built to conserve the adult and young star tortoises, which are found in the foothills and fields of Srikakulam. A stellar example of conservation which is in tune with the cultural and religious beliefs of people..
Let me conclude with this beautiful verse in the Sangam poetry, Kurunthokai, where the poet wrote:
யாவதும் அறிகிலர் கழறுவோரே,
தாய் இல் முட்டை போல உள் கிடந்து
சாயின் அல்லது பிறிது எவன் உடைத்தோ,
யாமைப் பார்ப்பின் அன்ன,
காமம் காதலர் கையற விடினே? 
Those who chide me, know not a thing
my passion is like a hatchling of tortoise
sustained by its mother;
if my lover forsakes me, it’ll wither
like an unhatched egg, for what else can sustains it?
(This photograph of Kurma Avatar is from a pillar at the hundred pillar mandapam at Varadaraja Swamy temple, Kanchipuram. Each pillar, adorned with exquisite carvings, is a treasure to savour)

25/05/23, 8:54 am - Dr Raguram: White Sands National Park is a park like no other with its stunning white, gypsum dunes. It has the highest concentration of gypsum sand dunes of anywhere in the world. It is a magical experience to walk/climb on the powdery white sands. The plants at the Park have found their own ways to adapt to life in the demanding desert conditions. When I saw this small clutch of grass growing in the midst of the vast sand dune, I was reminded of these words of Henry Miller in the book ‘Black Spring.’
“I have a theory that the moment one gives close attention to anything, even a blade of grass, it becomes a mysterious, awesome, indescribably magnificent world in itself. I have tried this experiment a thousand times and I have never been disappointed. The more I look at a thing, the more I see in it, and the more I see in it, the more I want to see. It is like peeling an onion. There is always another layer, and another, and another. And each layer is more beautiful than the last. 
This is the way I look at the world. I don't see it as a collection of objects, but as a vast and mysterious organism. I see the beauty in the smallest things, and I find wonder in the most ordinary events. I am always looking for the hidden meaning, the secret message. I am always trying to understand the mystery of life.
I know that I will never understand everything, but that doesn't stop me from trying. I am content to live in the mystery, to be surrounded by the unknown. I am content to be a seeker, a pilgrim, a traveller on the road to nowhere.”
KINDLY DO NOT SHARE WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT!
25/05/23, 9:07 am - Nalini N R: Thank you Sir for the detailed narration, a recapitulation. Turtles are considered as bringing luck. Indian culture contributes to the preservation of trees and animals, nature worshipped as God.
25/05/23, 9:12 am - Nalini N R: Such a wonderful message for the constantly dissatisfied discontent human beings. A welcome attitude with so much of acceptance of the unknown uncertainty and being spirited!

27/05/23, 9:50 am - Dr Raguram: Ahalya presented a book of collected short stories of John Cheever, sometime in the 80s. Cheever (whose birthday is today), was an insightful chronicler of suburban alienation, much like John Updike. He was truly the American Chekov! Among all the stories in the collection, I found The Swimmer, an exceptional one. 
When the story begins, Neddy, who is described as being near the prime of his life, decides to affirm his vitality by swimming his way home. With a ‘cartographer’s eye’, he plans his way through the swimming pools of the neighbours. At first his journey goes smoothly. He does, however, run into various obstacles, physical as well as emotional.  The pools get colder and harder to swim through. The neighbours become critical and less friendly. Fatigue overtakes him and he starts feeling lonely. Towards the end, he finds it difficult to swim and plods across the pools. Tired and feeling miserable, when he finally reaches his house only to find that it has been abandoned, his wife and children are nowhere to be found. He pounds on the door, peeps through the window and notices the house to be completely empty. At the end of his surreal voyage, his house is bereft of life. It is a moment worthy of a Greek tragedy. 
The metaphor of journey is one of the most widely used elements in literature. Quite often too in our lives we realize that our journey in life is nothing like what we thought it would be when we started. As Haruki Murakami observed perceptively, “Whatever it is you're seeking won't come in the form you're expecting.”
And at any time, there will always be people banging at the doors of their lost dreams…
Cheever was also a keen observer of nature and his stories are replete with wonderful descriptions like this one from his novel ‘Bullet Park’, about the red winged blackbirds and the loss of their migratory instincts:
“Below the house, near the grove of dead elms, there was a swamp where a flock of red-winged blackbirds nested each spring. According to the law of their species they should have turned south in the autumn but the number of bird-feeding appliances in the neighbourhood, overflowing with provender, had rattled their migratory instincts and they now spent the autumn and winter in Bullet Park in utter confusion. Their song—two ascending notes and a harsh trill like a cicada—was inalienably associated with the first long nights of summer but now one heard it in the autumn, one heard it in the snow.”
27/05/23, 10:49 pm - Nalini N R: Beautiful bird caught by you Sir unawares. The lines have hidden facts of life. A journey seeming long is spent in expectations, many a times too short to reach. But once we get into the path of looking at the journey from a different perspective things start falling into their places.

28/05/23, 9:42 am - Dr Raguram: Yesterday I had posted about the journey of life and its travails. It is a conspicuous fact that more and more people have been journeying to different parts of the country in search of jobs. It is an overwhelming reality. Sadly, they were one of the most vulnerable groups during the lockdown, as their very livelihood came to a complete standstill. The lockdown culminated in a never-seen-before reverse migration as people started making often perilous journey to their villages and homes. While middle class Indians were busy banging utensils, scores of migrants were on the road, braving hostile conditions and an unempathic government. It was the largest migration in India after the partition. Though there was no major connection between the exodus and a spike in infection, they were treated as outcasts, socially distanced. The movie ‘Bheed’, is a poignant reminder of this human tragedy.
On this day when the new parliament is being inaugurated, we mustn’t forget that more than sixty thousand workers, majority of them migrant labourers were involved in its construction which began in the middle of a brutal second wave of covid pandemic.

29/05/23, 8:28 am - Dr Raguram: As the Sengol is safely ensconced in a glass case and the debates, discussions and drama about it settles down, let me draw attention to a poet (whose birthdays was yesterday), whom I admire deeply, K Satchidanandan. His poems are fascinating excursions embellished with a deeply reflective, gentle voice. In his own words, “I mark my passage with words that smell life”.
I particularly like his poem ‘Gandhi and Poetry’, which I am quoting in full:
One day a lean poem
reached Gandhi’s ashram
to have a glimpse of the man.
Gandhi spinning away
his thread towards Ram
took no notice of the poem
waiting at his door,
ashamed at not being a bhajan.
The poem now cleared his throat
And Gandhi glanced at him sideways
through those glasses that had seen hell.
“Have you ever spun thread?” he asked,
“Ever pulled a scavenger’s cart?
Ever stood in the smoke of
An early morning kitchen?
Have you ever starved?”

The poem said: “I was born in the woods,
in a hunter’s mouth.
A fisherman brought me up
in a cottage.
Yet I knew no work, I only sing.
First I sang in the courts:
then I was plump and handsome
but am on the streets now,
half-starved.”

“That’s better,” Gandhi said
with a sly smile. “But you must give up this habit
of speaking in Sanskrit at times.
Go to the fields. Listen to
The peasants’ speech.”
The poem turned into a grain
and lay waiting in the fields
for the tiller to come
and upturn the virgin soil
moist with new rain. 
Kindled by thoughts, fuelled by ink, poems like this have a way of finding their home within us
29/05/23, 10:32 pm - Nalini N R: Such a magnificent tree and what a capture! I can literally feel the cool in this unbearable weather. And the poem, a very different but a simple way  of conveying the message.

31/05/23, 7:44 am - Dr Raguram: One day when I was a student at NIMHANS in late 1970s, my teacher and mentor, Dr RL Kapur asked me (which he often used to!) as to what book I was reading. I told him about an interesting book ‘Dice Man’ by Luke Rhinehart in which a man starts making decisions in his life, guided by chance, through the throw of the dice. He suggested that I read Jacques Monod’s ‘Chance and Necessity’. Intrigued by the title, I set about searching for it. Not surprisingly, I found it in the Select Book Shop. When I mentioned the title, Mr Murthy walked over to an over stacked bookshelf and handed over the book to me. It was tough a reading at first. On subsequent, more careful reading I could discern the major themes of the book.
On ‘chance’ Jacques Monod comments, “It necessarily follows that chance alone is at the source of every innovation, and of all creation in the biosphere. Pure chance, absolutely free but blind, at the very root of the stupendous edifice of evolution: this central concept of modern biology is no longer one among many other possible or even conceivable hypotheses. It is today the sole conceivable hypothesis, the only one that squares with observed and tested fact”. With regard to ‘necessity’ it refers to the fact that, “the enzyme must act as it does, catalysing a reaction with one substrate but not another, according to the constraints imposed by its structure”. He emphasizes that chance and necessity has to be subjected to scientific evaluation and that an objective stance, shorn of value judgements is an important requirement in the pursuit of knowledge. Pointing out to the crucial role of ethics of knowledge acquisition in modern science, the author makes an incisive comment that, “In science, self-satisfaction is death. Personal self-satisfaction is the death of the scientist. Collective self-satisfaction is the death of research. It is the restlessness, anxiety, dissatisfaction, agony of mind that nourish Science”.
I read some more about the author and found out that he was a close associate of Albert Camus and that the book was the outcome of several hours of long discussions between the two. 
Jacques Monod (whose birthday is today), was many things in his life: an aspiring orchestra conductor, hero of the French Resistance and was deeply involved in assisting scientists facing persecution in totalitarian regimes. He was often referred to as ‘Camus in a lab coat’. 
Interestingly, chance played a significant part in his life. He was about to embark on a scientific expedition to Greenland when one of his colleagues from the faculty of natural sciences at the Sorbonne, convinced him to go to the California Institute of Technology in USA to study genetics on a Rockefeller scholarship. That chance decision saved his life, as the ship on which he was to travel with the expedition sank and there were no survivors!

01/06/23, 6:20 am - Dr Raguram: Yesterday I had written about the role of chance and the throw of dice. The game of dice played a crucial role in the Mahabharata. The Kauravas (led by Duryodhana) challenged the Paṇḍavas to a game of dice and in the process robbed them of their kingdom, violated their queen Draupadi, and exiled them for thirteen years. As a consequence of these egregious acts, war between the two sets of cousins unfolded. 
The dice game contained one of the most disturbing instances in the epic. When Draupadi underwent humiliation at the hands of the Kauravas, the elders who were present did nothing to stop the act. They chose to be passive witnesses to the horrendous act. Standing before her husbands and elders, humiliated and shamed, she questions Yudhiṣṭhira, “Whom did you lose first, yourself or me?” This most poignant question was met with deafening silence. Draupadi comments, “It is sad; in this vast assembly here, there are no elders in the true sense. The so called elders are unable say what is Dharma. There is neither Dharma nor Truth here”. 
Why were the most eminent men in the hall blind to the immense suffering caused to Draupadi? The concept of dharma ruptured at that moment.
Pratibha Ray’s "Yajnaseni: The Story of Draupadi" is one of the most powerful narratives which unravels  the dilemma and plight of Draupadi. The author gives voice to Draupadi’s angst, “Full of anguish and anger I was thinking: was woman merely man’s movable or immovable property? Being a woman did I not have the right even over myself, my own soul? If they had rights over this body of mine, did it mean they could do as they wished with me?”
The same question arises when one witnesses the plight and suffering of women wrestlers who brought glory to our country. 
Wonder whether anything has changed at all? Draupadi continues to be slighted even today.
(This photograph which depicts the dice game from Mahabharata, is from a small panel in the Amruteshwara Temple at Amruthapura in Chikmagalur district)
01/06/23, 7:51 pm - Nalini N R: Chance, probably broadens the pursuit and does not narrow down to clear cut road. Food for thought Sir. How he escaped death by chance or destined to survive?
01/06/23, 8:01 pm - Nalini N R: Very shameful incidence and on top of it Arjuna laments about waging a war against so called elders. Such a beautiful sculpture depicting the game a root cause for the war.

02/06/23, 9:06 am - Dr Raguram: Many of us wonder, at some point in our lives, as to how we will be remembered after our demise. What would people recollect and reminiscence about us ‘afterwards’? Thomas Hardy (whose birthday is today) gave creative expression to it in his poem, ‘Afterwards’. Although he is best known for his many novels which we would have read during our school/college days, his first love was poetry. He went on writing poetry right until the end of his life, dictating his last poem while on his death bed. ‘Afterwards’ reads as if it is his own elegy and was, in fact, read during the memorial service after his death. Replete with beautiful imagery, it is one of his finest poems, and my favourite too!
AFTERWARDS
When the Present has latched its postern behind my tremulous stay
And the May month flaps its glad green leaves like wings,
Delicate-filmed as new-spun silk, will the neighbours say,
"He was a man who used to notice such things"? 
If it be in the dusk when, like an eyelid's soundless blink,
The dewfall-hawk comes crossing the shades to alight
Upon the wind-warped upland thorn, a gazer may think,
"To him this must have been a familiar sight."
If I pass during some nocturnal blackness, mothy and warm,
When the hedgehog travels furtively over the lawn,
One may say, "He strove that such innocent creatures should come to no harm,
But he could do little for them; and now he is gone."
If, when hearing that I have been stilled at last, they stand at the door,
Watching the full-starred heavens that winter sees,
Will this thought rise on those who will meet my face no more,
"He was one who had an eye for such mysteries"?
And will any say when my bell of quittance is heard in the gloom,
And a crossing breeze cuts a pause in its outrollings,
Till they rise again, as they were a new bell's boom,
“He hears it not now, but used to notice such things?"
02/06/23, 8:30 pm - Nalini N R: Very nice and simple but there is a hope in his lines that someone is inspired to consciously 'notice such things'. Everyone appears to be too busy with gadgets and gone too far away from nature thanks to AI which will make progeny dumb and numb.

03/06/23, 8:46 am - Dr Raguram: The bicycle was an important invention in the history of mankind. It is the first mode of transport that was powered by nothing more than our physical bodies and the forerunner of eco-conscious vehicles. Each one of us would have ridden a cycle at least once in our lives, fallen down in the process of learning, enjoyed the fresh breath of air as we balanced ourselves delicately and pedalled to discover. 
The bicycle has also been an inspiring metaphor in movies.
In ‘Bicycle Thieves’, it is a means of sustenance from overriding, abject poverty. When the protagonist loses it, his world is shattered and in an attempt to overcome it, he steals another one and gets thoroughly bashed up and humiliated in the process. The movie ends with the father and son, reduced to tears, walking away from the crowd, holding hands. 
There is a different and interesting perspective in the Marathi movie ‘Cycle’. When the cycle is stolen from the main character Keshav, the entire village grieves with him. The thieves soon realize how the villagers are so affectionate about the person and his cycle, and ridden with guilt, they write a letter to Keshav and return the cycle. When he passes by a dilapidated house with no rooftop, he finds the owner quite composed. When Keshav asks him, the house owner says, “last year when I was going through difficult times, I came to you for guidance; I still remember what you said then, don’t get stuck with things.” It is a moment of revelation for Keshav and he gifts his cycle to a child. Both the movies portray the cycle from different perspectives. In one, it is a need and a necessity to steer through daunting circumstances in life. In the other, a source of attachment and its loss, which is negotiated through inherent goodness in people.
The bicycle has also inspired the muse in artists. One of the most creative interpretation of the cycle is in Picasso’s sculpture, ‘Bull’s Head’, which was crafted from a discarded seat and handlebars of a cycle. An astonishing metamorphosis in the hands of a genius.
As Arthur Conan Doyle commented, “When the spirits are low, when the day appears dark, when work becomes monotonous, when hope hardly seems worth having, just mount a bicycle and go out for a spin down the road, without thought on anything but the ride you are taking.”
I am posting this in admiration of our dear friend and an ardent cyclist Dr Mohan Raj, on the occasion of the World Bicycle Day

04/06/23, 12:46 pm - Dr Raguram: The catastrophic train accident resulting in scores of deaths, is an unsurpassed human tragedy in recent time. Many more have been injured and the traumatic event will leave its footprints in their memory for long. Such terrifying experiences lurk deeply within, impacting emotional life and behaviour in myriad, unsettling ways. Coping with internalized trauma over time, is not an easy task.
WHR Rivers (whose death anniversary is today) in his pioneering work drew attention to the terrifying internalized experiences of traumatic memories, albeit in a different context, World War I.  
River’s insightful observation was that traumatic memories were often repressed because there was a “conflict between the mental tendencies of the individual and the traditional code of conduct prescribed by society”. He published an account of his work in the Lancet in 1918, stating: ‘New symptoms often arise in hospital or at home which are not the immediate and necessary consequence of the war experience, but are due to repression of painful memories and thoughts, or of unpleasant affective states arising out of reflection concerning this experience.’
In dealing with these troublesome memories, Rivers emphasized the importance of a humanistic engagement with the traumatised patients, exploring the meaning of their experiences through ’talking cure’. He employed what he termed as ‘autognosis’, which was a two-part process. The first was focused on educating the patient and helping him to realize that the illness he was experiencing was neither “strange” nor permanent. The second part was talk therapy, which involved discussing traumatic experiences at an in-depth level with patients and helping them to work through their painful experiences in more positive ways. 
Notable amongst his patients the war poet Siegfried Sassoon, who wrote fondly of Rivers compassionate bedside manner in a poem which he sent to the poet Robert Graves:
But yesterday my reasoning Rivers ran solemnly in,
With peace in the pools of his spectacled eyes and a wisely omnipotent grin;
And I fished in that steady grey stream and decided that I
after all am no longer the Worm that refuses to die.
Pat Barker’ ‘Regeneration Trilogy’ gives a wonderful, fictionalized account of WHR Rivers and his monumental work with soldiers traumatized by the war
04/06/23, 5:38 pm - Nalini N R: Such a warm narrative Sir. Hope the bicycle days come back as the fuel cannot last longer.
04/06/23, 5:44 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. Heartrending scenes. But how many of those survivors how many migrant laborers get the opportunity to talk to a professional. What has affected the body is treated but mind??

05/06/23, 7:21 am - Dr Raguram: It is a sad and uncomfortable truth that we have become alienated from the environment we live in. Environmental degradation in the guise of development is occurring at an increasing, unsettling pace. Hardly do we realize that the environment within and outside of us are deeply interconnected. Every day of our lives, our breath connects us to the environment. We gasp for fresh air in the midst of clouds of pollutants that hold their unrelenting sway over us.
World environment day draws attention to the need for a deep communion and communication between us and the environment. As Thoreau commented, “What is the use of a house if you haven't got a tolerable planet to put it on?”
Let us heed to the sanely advice of Theodore Roosevelt, who was instrumental in establishing 150 national forests, 51 federal bird reserves, four national game preserves, five national parks and 18 national monuments on over 230 million acres of public land: “Here is your country. Cherish these natural wonders, cherish the natural resources, cherish the history and romance as a sacred heritage, for your children and your children's children. Do not let selfish men or greedy interests skin your country of its beauty, its riches or its romance.”

06/06/23, 8:35 am - Dr Raguram: Alexander Pushkin (whose birthday is today) is unquestionably Russia’s greatest writer and poet. Many consider him as the founder of modern Russian literature. In addition to being a master of the Russian language, he spoke ten other languages. His library in his St Petersburg apartment had over 4,500 books in 14 languages.
‘Yevgeny Onegin’ was his major work and a masterpiece. He completed the work during a course of three months when he was in forced quarantine during a major cholera outbreak. It is a story of love, loss, rejection and despair of Onegin, who wastes his life, allows the girl who loves him to marry another, and lets himself be drawn into a duel in which he kills his best friend. It is a novel in verse form and was the muse for Vikram Seth’s “Golden Gate’. Inspired by the novel, Tchaikovsky wrote a brilliant opera. 
Throughout his life Pushkin took part in 90 duels and initiated 15 of them himself. One of those duels turned out to be his last when he was mortally wounded, defending his wife’s honour. He died with a substantial debt unpaid. Tsar Nicholas I, with whom Pushkin had a difficult relationship, ordered that the poet’s debt be paid off from the country’s treasury.
Pushkin’s oeuvre is unbelievably broad. He wrote classical odes, romantic poems, historical drama, novellas, short stories, fairy tales and travel journals. This poem titled, ‘A Little Bird’, is a favourite of mine:
In alien lands I keep the body
Of ancient native rites and things:
I gladly free a little birdie
At celebration of the spring.
I'm now free for consolation,
And thankful to almighty Lord:
At least, to one of his creations
I've given freedom in this world!
06/06/23, 10:50 pm - Nalini N R: Because we have contributed to the degradation, it is slapping back through climate change. Each one of us in a small way should try to save it.

07/06/23, 6:39 am - Dr Raguram: As we journey in life, often we pose a question to ourselves: Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? A question that has been in the realm of philosophers down the ages. It was also the title of a famous painting by Paul Gaugin (whose birthday is today). He started working on it when he was beset with multiple problems; his health was failing, he was estranged from his wife and his daughter to whom he was deeply attached, died of pneumonia. In throes of deep distress, he started wondering about the meaning and purpose of his life. This massive painting was an expression of this search.
After finishing the canvas in feverish frenzy, he put down the brush, walked up a hill near his home in Tahiti and swallowed a huge amount of arsenic. But the arsenic failed to kill him. 
He wrote a detailed note about this work and mentioned, “I believe that this canvas not only surpasses all my previous work, but that I will never do anything better or even like it. Before dying I put into it all my energy, a passion so painful, in terrible circumstances, and a vision so clear, needing no correction, that the hastiness disappears and life surges up…I have finished a philosophical work on this theme, comparable to the Gospels”. 
Often, while looking at paintings like this, I wonder, how does a painting begin in an artist’s mind, unravel itself in forms and colours, find its way within us and does this each and every time we look at it?

08/06/23, 7:40 am - Dr Raguram: I have enjoyed watching Anthony Bourdain’s shows. His gastronomical pursuits often in exotic locales with his cocky commentaries were always fun to watch. Hence it was a surprise that he took his life on this day five years ago.
Every suicide is a mystery and tragedy unto itself. There is often a background against which the act is enacted. There were indications of simmering emotional distress which Bourdain himself acknowledged. ‘Spirals of depression’, left him lonely and exhausted. Only once he met up with a therapist in Buenos Aires, which was aired in a 2016 “Parts Unknown” segment. “I can find myself in a spiral of depression that can last for days,” he tells the therapist and goes on to add, “It’s an isolating feeling. I communicate for a living but I’m terrible at communicating with the people I care about.” He also shared with the therapist, a recurring dream he had been having that involved him being stuck inside a Victorian-style hotel with “endless rooms and hallways, where he could never check out.” He recalled wanting to go home during the dream, but never being able to remember where his home actually was.
The dream is so poignant reflecting the travails of a media star who was wandering from place to place, shooting episodes in far off locations and haunted by crushing loneliness. He seemed to have lived an untethered existence. 
It is tragic that even though he acknowledged his emotional distress, he never sought proper professional assistance and that too in a country where every source of help is was available. Media stars lead a double life. Their public image is often in stark contrast to their private lives. Once the gulf widens, they unfortunately get trapped within the image while their angst and distress remain in the realm of “Parts Unknown”. This incidentally was the title of his popular show. 
As Kay Redfield Jamison wrote in her book, ‘Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide’, “Suicide is not a blot on anyone’s name; it is a tragedy….each way to suicide is its own: intensely private, unknowable, and terrible. Suicide will have seemed to its perpetrator the last and best of bad possibilities, and any attempt by the living to chart this final terrain of life can be only a sketch, maddeningly incomplete ”
08/06/23, 2:07 pm - Nalini N R: Wonderful artists but their own challenges. What they depict, the depth of their work and mind, probably is not something which everyone understands. The gap is so overwhelming for them. It is so sad that they end their lives but do they?

09/06/23, 7:52 am - Dr Raguram: There is something magical about oceans. Sometimes it is calm and welcoming. It is a soothing experience to hear the sea water gently caressing the sandy shores. It has other moods too, when suddenly huge waves crash onto the shores with renewed vigor. It is playful when it catches you unaware, stroking your feet with a warm spray as you walk carefully along the edges, trying to keep your feet clean. Sometimes when I see plastic bottles and trash thrown carelessly on its shore, I wonder whether it is weeping silently, within. Whatever way I strive to describe it, there is always something that eludes me.
When its water touches me, I am aware that I am touching eternity.
The poet Nayyirah Waheed articulated this feeling beautifully:
“if
the ocean
can calm itself,
so can you.
we
are both
salt water
mixed with
air.”
(Yesterday was the World Ocean Day)
10/06/23, 8:45 am - Dr Raguram: This post is about a diminutive, captivating temple. Since it is a bit long, I’ve posted it in my website. Take time over the weekend, savour it and feel free to share your perceptions in the blog: https://www.profraguram.com/musings--reflections/mesmerizing-melakadambur
10/06/23, 6:36 pm - Nalini N R: Ocean caught so beautifully with an edge of thin layer of water and the layers of sand on one side and looks like it is merging with the endless sky on the other. And what a simile given by the author!

11/06/23, 8:02 am - Dr Raguram: Long back, I picked up a slim novel, ‘Lie down in darkness’ by William Styron. It was a deeply unsettling, poignant account of a family in the process of disintegration. It opens with the suicide of the daughter of the family and as the novel unfolds, we get to know her turbulent emotional background behind the act of self-destruction. As she narrates, “Which is worse, past or future? Neither. I will fold up my mind like a leaf and drift on this stream over the brink. Which will be soon, and then the dark, and then be done with this ugliness...”
Many years late, William Styron found himself in throes of a similar overwhelming sadness. He went through a period of prolonged, severe, suicidal depression and wrote a harrowing account of his experience in ‘Darkness Visible: A Memoir of Madness’. Characterizing depression as ‘the howling tempest in the brain’, he described it as "a disorder of mood, so mysteriously painful and elusive in the way it becomes known to the self – to the mediating intellect, as to verge close to being beyond description. It thus remains nearly incomprehensible to those who have not experienced it in its extreme mode.” 
At the end of the book, the author comments, referring to Dante: “For those who have dwelt in depression’s dark wood, and known its inexplicable agony, their return from the abyss is not unlike the ascent of the poet, trudging upward and upward out of hell’s black depths and at last emerging into what he saw as ‘the shining world.’ There, whoever has been restored to health has almost always been restored to the capacity for serenity and joy, and this may be indemnity enough for having endured the despair beyond despair.” 
The book is a moving vocabulary of depression that unlocks the unspoken, hidden suffering of many who are afflicted with it.  
The title ‘Darkness Visible’, might sound a bit puzzling. It alludes to a poem in Milton’s ‘Paradise Lost’: 
“Now the thought
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain
Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes
That witnessed huge affliction and dismay
Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate:
At once as far as angels ken he views
The dismal situation waste and wild,
A dungeon horrible, on all sides round
As one great furnace flamed, yet from those flames
No light, but rather darkness visible
Served only to discover sights of woe,
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
That comes to all; but torture without end
Still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed
With ever-burning sulfur unconsumed.”
In this book, William Styron (whose birthday is today) extends a reassuring hand to those suffering from depression by pointing out that it is possible to see and work through the darkness of depression and continue the journey in life, afresh.

12/06/23, 10:43 am - Dr Raguram: National Red Rose Day is celebrated on June 12, to pay tribute to one of the most iconic symbols of love and romance throughout history.  
In Greek myth, roses are closely linked with Adonis, the lover of Aphrodite. One day, Adonis was gored by a wild boar during a hunting trip and died in Aphrodite’s arms as she wept; the first red roses were said to have sprung up from his blood as it soaked into the earth, staining the nearby white roses a deep crimson. Red roses came to be inextricably linked to romantic love, highlighting that such love transcends death and lives on beyond the lovers’ own short lives. 
Interestingly, in three different languages, Spanish, Portuguese and French, the word ‘rose’ means ‘red’!
12/06/23, 10:53 pm - Nalini N R: Though it is saddening to note the deep side of depression, very heartening to note how it can be worked through.

13/06/23, 8:44 am - Dr Raguram: Long ago when I was on a Commonwealth Fellowship in London, I was staying on the outskirts of the city which involved lengthy commute by the tube. During all these travels, what kept me company were poems that were strategically placed on posters and billboards across the tube stations. I was introduced to many a poet and WB Yeats (whose birthday is today), was one among them. I particularly liked this poem of his:
HE WISHES FOR THE CLOTHS OF HEAVEN
Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half-light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.
How can one forget these lines from his poem, ‘The Second Coming’:
Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.
The last two lines are unsettling true, even now…

14/06/23, 5:23 am - Dr Raguram: Memory is an intrinsic part of our everyday lives. We are what we remember and what we forget too.  Our brains are designed to forget things. Many a time when I try to recollect things, I can sense the chaos in my neuronal circuitry! 
Is it possible for someone to remember everything in his life? 
The first documented case of extraordinary memory was by the celebrated Russian psychologist Alexander Luria. Starting in the 1920s, the person whom he studied was able to remember long sequences of numbers and details many years after hearing them. After studying the person for more than 30 years, Luria confessed his inability to find a limit to his memory, a surprising statement considering that it came from one of the foremost psychologists of his time.
In the realm of literature, there is an interesting short story ‘Funes The Memorious’, by Jorge Luis Borges, who died on this day in 1986. It narrates the travails of Ireneo Funes, who after falling off a horse and hitting his head hard, recovers consciousness with the incredible ability or perhaps curse, of remembering absolutely everything. Borges suggests that this kind of extraordinary memory has its own pitfalls. Says Fune, “I alone have more memories than all men may have ever had since the world exists. My memory, sir, is like a rubbish heap.” 
Borges goes on to write, “Of the magical compadrito of my story I can state that he is a precursor to supermen, a suburban, incomplete Zarathustra; what cannot be denied is that he is a monster.” 
In the era of ChatGPT and AI, ‘Funes the Memorious,’ the story about a man who remembers everything, but understands nothing seems so visionary!
Borges also wrote some captivating poems, like this one about the tiger:
THE OTHER TIGER
A tiger comes to mind. The twilight here
Exalts the vast and busy Library
And seems to set the bookshelves back in gloom;
Innocent, ruthless, bloodstained, sleek
It wanders through its forest and its day
Printing a track along the muddy banks
Of sluggish streams whose names it does not know
(In its world there are no names or past
Or time to come, only the vivid now)
And makes its way across wild distances
Sniffing the braided labyrinth of smells
And in the wind picking the smell of dawn
And tantalizing scent of grazing deer;
Among the bamboo's slanting stripes I glimpse
The tiger's stripes and sense the bony frame
Under the splendid, quivering cover of skin.
Curving oceans and the planet's wastes keep us
Apart in vain; from here in a house far off
In South America I dream of you,
Track you, O tiger of the Ganges' banks.

It strikes me now as evening fills my soul
That the tiger addressed in my poem
Is a shadowy beast, a tiger of symbols
And scraps picked up at random out of books,
A string of labored tropes that have no life,
And not the fated tiger, the deadly jewel
That under sun or stars or changing moon
Goes on in Bengal or Sumatra fulfilling
Its rounds of love and indolence and death.
To the tiger of symbols I hold opposed
The one that's real, the one whose blood runs hot
As it cuts down a herd of buffaloes,
And that today, this August third, nineteen
Fifty-nine, throws its shadow on the grass;
But by the act of giving it a name,
By trying to fix the limits of its world,
It becomes a fiction not a living beast,
Not a tiger out roaming the wilds of earth.

We'll hunt for a third tiger now, but like
The others this one too will be a form
Of what I dream, a structure of words, and not
The flesh and one tiger that beyond all myths
Paces the earth. I know these things quite well,
Yet nonetheless some force keeps driving me
In this vague, unreasonable, and ancient quest,
And I go on pursuing through the hours
Another tiger, the beast not found in verse.

16/06/23, 7:43 am - Dr Raguram: For me nature is home. Being amidst it, soothes my soul. In the midst of tall trees, expansive grasslands, I feel suffused with an indescribable, subtle calmness and peace. It is a meditative experience.
Sometimes I translate what I experience through the camera , which incidentally, is not a high end one.  Like all translations, often it may be a poor representation of what I see through my own lenses of perception. I have inscribed those moments within the coils of my neurons and cherish them deeply.
Nature can be very astounding. In the middle of a vast dry desert landscape strewn with barren hills, suddenly one comes face to face a burst of resplendent colours or rocky surfaces. This radiant, multihued mountain landscape is not surprisingly called, The Artist Palette!
(15th June was the National Nature Photography Day)
17/06/23, 7:10 pm - Nalini N R: Very true Sir. Splashes of unusual colours sprayed what we don't expect. Lucky are those who get opportunity to be amidst nature and enjoy the blissful experience. The photographs and your narration definitely tickle our imagination!

19/06/23, 10:39 am - Dr Raguram: Walking has a long history. Ever since our earliest hominids took the first bipedal steps, we have not stopped walking! Walking has served as a tool for political protests, affirmation of civil, human rights and in quest of the divine. The simple act of putting one step ahead of the other has also been medicalized over time. Physicians emphasize its health benefits and each and every smartphone has an app to count the number of steps taken during walking. One can often notice people with headphones striding briskly keeping pace with the magical number of healthy steps. 
In 1862 David Thoreau’s wrote an interesting essay titled ‘Walking’. In it, he drew attention to the difference between walking and sauntering. When we walk, we concentrate on pace or getting somewhere, as quickly as possible. Sauntering is vastly different. When we saunter, we pause, look around, listen and immerse ourselves in the world outside. Thoreau observed that the word saunter might have originated with those who took pilgrimages to the Holy Land, the sainted land: ‘sainte terre’. Or perhaps from the idea of being without land ownership, ‘sans terre’, which, for him, meant having no particular home but being “equally at home everywhere.” The trick, according to Thoreau, is not to take your inside life out but to go present and empty. 
We often rush through our lives. How much better it would be to "saunter" along this trail of life, lingering hither and thither, pausing for a while in the company of trees, listening to the melodies of the wind as it courses through the leaves, keeping an ear for the songs of the birds and watch petite flowers growing? 
In the words of Simon and Garfunkel:
Slow down, you move too fast
You got to make the morning last
Just kicking down the cobblestones
Looking for fun and feeling groovy
Ba da-da da-da da-da, feeling groovy
Hello lamppost, what'cha knowing
I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Ain't you got no rhymes for me?
Doo-ait-n-doo-doo, feeling groovy
Ba da-da da-da da-da, feeling groovy
I got no deeds to do, no promises to keep
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morningtime drop all its petals on me
Life, I love you, all is groovy
(Notes on the World Sauntering Day!)
19/06/23, 7:39 pm - Nalini N R: Oh never knew there was some day called World Sauntering Day. In the maddening world, dependence on vehicles people have forgotten to walk let alone saunter! So important to slow down and look around not buildings but nature....photograph is wonderful Sir. Have to suffice with virtual sauntering😔 caption conveys the message of simple meaningful life.

21/06/23, 8:53 am - Dr Raguram: In Bhagavat Gita, Chapter 6, Dhyana Yoga, Sri Krishna outlines the processes of Ashtanga Yoga, lucidly, in verses 20-23
यत्रोपरमते चित्तं निरुद्धं योगसेवया |
यत्र चैवात्मनात्मानं पश्यन्नात्मनि तुष्यति || ६-२०||
yatroparamate chittaṁ niruddhaṁ yoga-sevayā
yatra chaivātmanātmānaṁ paśhyann ātmani tuṣhyati
When the mind, restrained from material activities, becomes still by the practice of Yoga, then the yogi is able to behold the soul through the purified mind, and he rejoices in the inner joy.
सुखमात्यन्तिकं यत्तद् बुद्धिग्राह्यमतीन्द्रियम् ।
वेत्ति यत्र न चैवायं स्थितश्चलति तत्त्वतः ॥ ६-२१॥
sukhamātyantikaṃ yattad buddhigrāhyamatīndriyam
vetti yatra na caivāyaṃ sthitaścalati tattvataḥ
When he (the Yogi) feels that Infinite bliss which can be grasped by the (pure) intellect and which transcends the senses he never moves from the Reality;
यं लब्ध्वा चापरं लाभं मन्यते नाधिकं ततः ।
यस्मिन्स्थितो न दुःखेन गुरुणापि विचाल्यते ॥ ६-२२॥
yaṃ labdhvā cāparaṃ lābhaṃ manyate nādhikaṃ tataḥ
yasminsthito na duḥkhena guruṇāpi vicālyate
Which, having obtained, he thinks there is no other gain superior to it; wherein established, he is not moved even by heavy sorrow.
तं विद्याद् दुःखसंयोगवियोगं योगसंज्ञितम् ।
स निश्चयेन योक्तव्यो योगोऽनिर्विण्णचेतसा ॥ ६-२३॥
taṃ vidyād duḥkhasaṃyogaviyogaṃ yogasaṃjñitam
sa niścayena yoktavyo yogo’nirviṇṇacetasā
Let it be known: the severance from the union with pain is Yoga. This Yoga should be practised with determination and with a mind steady and undespairing.

22/06/23, 10:48 am - Dr Raguram: There is something surreal about venturing into a rainforest. It was quite sunny when I entered the forest, but soon I was enveloped in darkness with sun peering through the tall trees occasionally. It was humid inside and the noisy cicadas showered me with their squirts of fluid, like raindrops. I made my way gingerly amongst the moist leaves and broken branches in the forest floor. Birds kept fluttering by but it was difficult to observe them clearly in the dense foliage. The Japanese have a wonderful word to describe the experience, ‘shinrin-yoku’ or ‘forest bathing’. It refers to the contemplative experience of being immersed in the sights, sounds and smells of the forest. 
Rainforests are cradles of biodiversity. Unfortunately, their loss continues, unabated at a blistering pace. As EO Wilson commented, “destroying rainforests for economic gains is like burning a renaissance painting to cook a meal”. 
The rainforests hold answers for many of the question that besiege us in an era of escalating global warming. The problem is that we turn a deaf ear to them.
A world without rainforest is akin to a man without lungs.
Let us wander into the rainforest where the wifi is weak, discover its magic, feel and cherish the connection to Mother Earth.

It was selected because on this date in 1967, the band participated in Our World, a program on the BBC that was broadcast to a global audience. They performed their song “All You Need Is Love.” 
It is remarkable how four dissimilar men came together to create music that is timeless. Whether raucous or reflective, there is immense beauty and enduring magic in their music. Ahalya and myself are unabashed aficionados of Beatles and listen to them often to revive our spirit and love of life.

26/06/23, 10:01 am - Dr Raguram: Kailasanathar temple in Kanchipuram is replete with some of the most exquisite sculptures, each one of them deftly chiseled. As I was going around the temple, this figure caught my attention. Carved out of sandstone, it’s lower half has eroded over time. Sometimes brokenness has the power, unlike anything else, to bring forth the hidden loveliness. The serene face seems to emerge from the scarred surface with a delicate charm and beauty. 
As we course through life, we invariably bear scars. In ‘The Winter of Our Discontent’, John Steinbeck wrote “to be alive at all is to have scars”.  Seared with scars, we strive to weather the storms of life with renewed resilience.  Scars sculpt us into what we can be.
26/06/23, 10:51 pm - Nalini N R: My son Adithya was an ardent fan of the band!
26/06/23, 10:59 pm - Nalini N R: A portion of the body with a brightly lit face appears to be emerging from fire. Yes Sir, it is so important that we should not let the scars mar our face!
28/06/23, 9:39 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
28/06/23, 9:39 am - Dr Raguram: Akkamahadevi was a poet, saint, wanderer, mystic and seeker and her vachanas are passionate dialogues expressing her spiritual quest to unite with her Lord Chennamallikarjuna. In her journey in search of the divine, she found her home in the lap of nature amidst the dense forests of Kadali in the Srisaila mountain ranges of Andhra Pradesh and merged into the infinite.
Many of her vachanas abound with vivid descriptions of nature in which she converses with chirping birds, dancing peacocks and butterflies, asking them whether they have seen her divine lover.  The very word she used to address her beloved Shiva was Chennamallikarjuna, which AK Ramanujam translated as “Lord, white as jasmine”. 
Whenever I venture into a forest, this vachana of Akkamahadevi (which I have outlined in the photograph) wherein she experiences all of nature as a manifestation of the Lord Chennamallikarjuna, resonates deeply within me.
When the inner and outer world merge, we embrace the divine ‘Oneness’.
29/06/23, 12:44 pm - Nalini N R: Very true Sir. She considered Lord Shiva as her consort and not a human like Andal, Meera. Her vachana Tanukaragadavaralli is my favorite song.

30/06/23, 2:11 pm - Dr Raguram: Today I lost one of my fellow travelers whom I had been treating for several decades. He was first admitted in NIMHANS with catatonia. He was in this state for a week and recovered with medication. Ever since that episode he has been in regular touch with me. Occasionally, he would slip into catatonia, but would recover quickly, to carry on his work as a teacher in a reputed residential school. Whenever I enquired about these episodes, there would be a lovely smile on his face, but he wouldn’t speak much about it. I was aware that there was a deep emotional substrate for his behavior, but made it a point not to force him, to ‘elicit’ psychopathology. It was a relationship built on compassion and empathy imbued with tacit trust. Being a fiercely independent person, he made the decision to live by himself and not return to his family home after retirement. He lived alone in a small house built entirely from his savings. He designed it in such a way so as to accommodate his vast collection of western music, which I would hear in the background during his calls, every month. Very regular with medication, he never skipped even a single dose.
A few years ago, on his own, he shared with me that he has been hearing voices which increased during these episodes and went on to offer a vivid description of them. He added as to how medications helped him to cope with them.
He was an aficionado of western classic music and used to send me YouTube links of the choicest recordings every morning. When I opened my computer this morning, there was none.
He would be the first person to wish me on ‘Teachers Day’. When I look back, I feel that he taught me many a thing about a chronic illness like schizophrenia. For people like him, it is a journey, often alone, in a strange country which as professionals we still strive to unravel. It continues to be an unsettling emotional terrain which patients negotiate with their own internal resources and remarkable resilience and he was a stellar example of that. He was alive even during the darkest moments in his life and the flame still glows.
Farewell my friend…
30/06/23, 5:14 pm - Nalini N R: A resilient person indeed. Music must have been his soul mate during the solitary journey. Wish he continues his journey peacefully.

02/07/23, 8:56 am - Dr Raguram: What draws me to Hermann Hesse (whose birthday is today), is his emphasis on self-realization in his novels. The quest for authentic self is a continuing strand in most of his works. The greatest example of it is of course, his slender novel, Siddhartha. The protagonist wanders through ancient India, in pursuit of an enlightened way of life, during the course of which he experiments with both spartan asceticism and luxurious hedonism. In the book’s most important scene, Siddhartha actually encounters the Buddha, but spurns him as he perceives that any kind of religion is an obstacle to enlightenment. “No one will ever attain redemption through doctrine! After all, the Buddha didn’t become the Buddha by following the Buddha!” Eventually, he finds spiritual wisdom by contemplating the flow of a great river and realizes that one can discover the true self only through wading alone in the waters of consciousness. 
Hermann Hesse underwent two spells of therapy with Jung. In his diary, he recorded some advice that the renowned analyst gave him. “Life’s problems aren’t there to be cleanly solved, each of them is a pair of opposites, that between them produce a tension that is called life”.
Hermann Hesse was also a keen observer of nature, especially trees. He wrote:
“For me, trees have always been the most penetrating preachers… in their highest boughs the world rustles, their roots rest in infinity; but they do not lose themselves there, they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only: to fulfil themselves according to their own laws, to build up their own form, to represent themselves. Nothing is holier, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree.”

03/07/23, 11:58 am - Dr Raguram: There are three kinds of teachers, in the context of spiritual education: Upadhyaya, Acharya, and Guru. Upadhyaya is one who teaches as a means of livelihood. Acharya is a preceptor who is a teacher and a guide. Guru is one who apart from imparting knowledge, guides the student to the path of liberation.
Advayataraka Upanishad  which is one of the 19 Upanishads attached to the Shukla Yajurveda, gives a description of the Gure in verse 16:
गुशब्दस्त्वन्धकारः स्यात् रुशब्दस्तन्निरोधकः ।
अन्धकारनिरोधित्वात् गुरुरित्यभिधीयते ॥ १६॥
The syllable Gu indicates darkness, the syllable Ru means its dispeller,
Because of the quality of dispelling darkness, the Guru is thus termed.
Four types of speech are described in ancient literature: verbal, mental, visual, and the transcendental. The verbal communication called as Vaikari. Higher than Vaikhari is Madhyama which is non-verbal communication through thoughts. Still advanced is Pashyanti which is communication through visual imagery, the person is made to “see” through the inner eye. The greatest form is “Para” which is “Silence,” where communication is without words, thoughts, or visions. It is kind of inner, intuitive, transcendental knowledge which is taught by Dakshinamurthy. 
In every Siva temple the stone image of Dakshinamurthy is installed, facing south, on the southern circumambulatory path around the sanctum sanctorum. Perhaps, of all Hindu Gods, he is the only one sitting facing south. 
This depiction of Dakshninamurthy is in the ceiling of Lokamahadevi temple at Pattadakkal. He is in a serene, meditative stance, yoga patta across him, with one leg on top of apasmara, flanked by two rishis and rishi patnis.
निधये सर्वविद्यानां भिषजे भवरोगिणाम् ।
गुरवे सर्वलोकानां दक्षिणामूर्तये नमः
The one who is the abode of all the knowledge, who is the healer of the diseased
The Guru to all the lokas, Salutations to you, Lord Dakshinamurthy

04/07/23, 9:01 am - Dr Raguram: A few years ago, I visited Belur math and expressed a desire to see the room where Swami Vivekananda used to reside. The room was facing the Ganga and the river was flowing gently caressed by the morning sun. It was such a serene setting and I could imagine the Swami meditating, absorbed in the scenic beauty of the river. The room was full of various objects and artefacts used by him, including a pakhawaj and tanpura. There was a bed on the floor with a garlanded photograph of his.
This was the place where the Swami passed away on this day, at the age of thirty nine years, five months and twenty four days. He embraced death, free of any fear or apprehension. He remarked to his devotees, “I shall never see forty… I delivered my message and I must go… The shadow of a big tree will not let the smaller trees grow up. I must go to make room.” In one of his letters to his disciples, he commented, “Coming and going is all pure delusion. The soul never comes nor goes. Where is the place to which it shall go, when all space is in the soul? When shall be the time for entering and departing, when all time is in the soul?”
One of the most popular saying of Swami Vivekananda is “Arise, Awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.” This has its origin in Katha Upanishad. In Katha Upanishad, chapter 1.3.14, we see Yama suggesting Nachiketa—
उत्तिष्ठत जाग्रत प्राप्य वरान्निबोधत,
क्षुरासन्न धारा निशिता दुरत्यद्दुर्गम पथ: तत् कवयो वदन्ति | 
Arise! Awake! Approach the great and learn.
Like the sharp edge of a razor is that path,
so the wise say−hard to tread and difficult to cross.
As Swami observed, “Sharp as the blade of a razor, long and difficult and hard to cross, is the way to liberation. The sages have declared this again and again. Yet do not let any weakness or failure bind you. The Upanishads have declared, ‘Arise! Awake! and stop not until the goal is reached.’ Cross the path, sharp as it is like the razor, however difficult it may be”.

05/07/23, 10:12 pm - Nalini N R: I personally feel very strong within whenever I read or hear about Swami Vivekananda's words. They are so sharp, no mincing of words and ignites the strength within. Thank you Sir for the description of the room. Though my maternal uncle was a Swamiji in the math never got a chance to visit. My client had sent the pic of the tree he had planted. I think you saw that👆

06/07/23, 9:15 am - Dr Raguram: Years ago, I had the privilege of seeing a comprehensive retrospective of the paintings of Frida Kahlo at the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco.  Commemorating the centennial of the artist’s birth, it brought together paintings that spanned her entire career, along with a selection of her own collection of photographs, most of which have never been on public display. Both Ahalya and myself spent several hours going through the galleries and it was an experience to cherish.
Frida Kahlo (whose birthday is today) was a remarkable woman. When she was 18, she was nearly killed in an accident and an iron handrail went into her hip and came out the other side. On top of this, she also broke her spinal column, collarbone, ribs, pelvis, right leg in eleven places, and dislocated her shoulder. Although she did eventually recover, she had to have 35 operations over her life to help with her spinal injuries, and she lived with chronic pain. Sitting in her bed with a specially designed easel, she took recourse to painting and gave expression to her persistent suffering. Frida created 143 paintings including 55 self-portraits. She was perhaps the first artist to extensively portray haunting struggles with pain, injury and disability.
Filled with vivid imagery, her painting ‘The Broken Column’ is a literal depiction of her physical and psychological wounds. It portrays a crumbling ionic column shooting through her torso, representing the spinal injuries she suffered in a bus accident and the dozens of subsequent surgeries she had to undergo. She is encased in restrictive metal corsets which she had to wear all through her life. Nails are embedded throughout her body, connoting her enduring tryst with pain. 
She died when she was just 47. A few days before her death, she wrote in her diary: “I hope the exit is joyful, and I hope never to return”.
When Ajit asked me to give a talk on ‘Arts and the Mind’, some time ago, during the South Zone Conference of the Indian Psychiatric Society Frida was my obvious choice.
07/07/23, 7:37 pm - Nalini N R: It is so very painful to see her painting and clearly depicts what hell she would have gone through🙄

08/07/23, 9:18 am - Dr Raguram: Manipur is burning and hearts have been singed. All our students who are from that region and currently staying outside are overwhelmed with deep distress and beset by a sense of helplessness. Many of them have reached out expressing their profound anguish. They are unable to reach their family and their loved ones.
The tangled web of violence has had a long imprint in our nation, right from the time of partition. Isn’t it imperative then, that as a nation we strive to address its recurrence with resolve and emotional commitment? Not a word from the head of our nation still. Mahatma Gandhi, if he was alive today would have taken the moral responsibility to quell the embers of violence, by actually being there.  
As Buddha observed, “Our sorrows and wounds are healed only when we touch them with compassion.”
Unfortunately that seems to be in short supply these days as lives continue to slip through uncaring hands . . .
10/07/23, 6:06 pm - Nalini N R: Very sad Sir. And even West Bengal is burning. May be Nature is also showing distress through disasters. No end to ordeal.

11/07/23, 8:23 am - Dr Raguram: Many of us grew up reading the piquant writings of Franz Kafka. On his birthday last week, I picked up his ‘Metamorphosis’ and read it again. It is a very intriguing novel which opens with a most preposterous scenario. Gregor Samsa, awakes one morning to find himself “transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin”.  He was the primary breadwinner of the family which was beset with various problems: his father an invalid, his mother asthmatic and his sister a young, frivolous girl. We follow Gregor and his family as they navigate through their turmoil to reconcile with his transformation. As the family struggles to come to terms with this change, they increasingly ill-treat and neglect him. He becomes isolated from his family, who hide him away in his bedroom. Gregor spends his time listening through the wall to his family members talking. They often discuss the difficult financial situation they find themselves in now that Gregor can’t provide for them. There is never any talk of seeking help or attempts at understanding Gregor’s transformation. Once he even hears his sister, who was once his close friend, saying “We can’t carry on like this. Maybe you can’t see it, but I can. I don’t want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is: we have to try and get rid of it.”  
Gregor’s end is quite poignant: “He soon made the discovery that he was no longer capable of moving at all. He remained in this state of empty, peaceful reflection until the clock tower struck the third hour of morning. He watched as everything began to lighten outside his window. Then his head sank all the way to the floor without volition and from his nostrils his last breath faintly streamed.” The cleaning lady gets rid of his body. 
Metamorphosis lends itself to variety of interpretations. For me it is symbolic of the manner people respond to disabling changes to a member of the family. People’s attitudes towards the disabled continue to be much like Grete’s. Taking care of them is often considered troublesome and they are treated as economic and emotional liabilities. His story mirrors the real world attitudes towards those who do not fit with the notions of accepted normality. Gregor is no longer a ‘dear one’ for the family, but a 'despicable creature' who has become a source of shame and embarrassment for them. Any person can metamorphose into an impaired being due to illness and changes that they have no control over. The novel outlines the dark side of dehumanization of a disabled person and the ostracism they have to endure. Although fictitious, Gregor’s situation echoes the anguish and pain experienced by bodily and emotionally challenged individuals even now. 
Kafka himself experienced an overwhelming sense of estrangement from his family, “Faced with intolerance and the tyranny of my parents, I live with my family more as a stranger than a foreigner”. He lived in a state of anxious solitude, not at home with his family, never been able to find a woman with whom he could share his travails. Perhaps Kafka perceived himself as an odd, alienated outlier, like Gregor and he wrote in his diary, “I am a cage, in search of a bird.”
11/07/23, 10:47 am - Dr Raguram: This year, Ahalya reaches a milestone on 23rd July, when she turns 70! Yes indeed -- hard to believe, but it's true!
Rahul created a Facebook page for you to share your memories, anecdotes, wishes and anything else that you may like to, from knowing her all these years. She will treasure this as the best gift on this occasion. If you are not in Facebook, pen your thoughts with photos (if you have some!) and send it across to rahul.raguram@gmail.com
11/07/23, 10:34 pm - Nalini N R: No words to describe what they go through. Unlike this narration, the family also suffers, subject to discrimination. Will there be any meaning left for the word human? No wonder if AI takes over.

12/07/23, 9:43 am - Dr Raguram: Henry David Thoreau whose birthday is today, was enchanted by trees and they played a significant role in his inner life. They were his constant guides and companions in his spiritual quest. Trees emerge in his writings as special symbols and images of the divine. The forest was his  cathedral, the woods his “sanctum sanctorum.”
Thoreau immersed himself in observing the shape, colour, texture and stances of trees. For him, exploring such details was an act of contemplation.  “A tree seen against other trees is a mere dark mass, but against the sky it has parts, has symmetry and expression.”
Trees revealed themselves poetically to Thoreau. They were “living poetry,” written by nature on the landscape. The shadows of trees on the ground at night were “like chandeliers of darkness.”
The writings of Thoreau helps me to see trees in new ways and they take on a deeper meaning in the process. 
Trees were wordless poems to him and each time I immerse myself listening to their unspoken words, I discover something anew. 
Unfortunately, we are losing the tree cover with an alarming rate in India. Around 2.3 million trees have been proposed to be cut to make way for mega infrastructure projects in the country. We are witnessing the biggest decline in deforestation in the past few years. Reports indicate that India lost 668400 hectares of forests in the past five years, second highest globally. 
During Thoreau’s lifetime too, there was increasing deforestation in New England his comment was “Thank God, they cannot cut down the clouds!”

14/07/23, 12:26 pm - Nalini N R: Man is digging his own grave. The photograph of the tree looks like an x-ray with its background colour enhancing the parts.
14/07/23, 12:36 pm - Nalini N R: Very True.. Sir. It is so unique to oneself. Hence, each one of us have to think of strategies to overcome suffering.

14/07/23, 11:17 am - Dr Raguram: One of the most beautiful experiences while walking through the woods is to listen to the sounds of the wind as it courses through the trees, caressing the leaves. Often it is a hypnotizing melody layered with descant notes. It is an enchanting experience to savor, especially when it is interspersed with bird songs. Sometimes while listening to these sounds, I wonder whether the trees and leaves are serenading each other.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow described it evocatively in his poem "A Day of Sunshine":
I hear the wind among the trees
Playing celestial symphonies
I see the branches downward bent,
Like keys of some great instrument.
I kept wondering for a long while as to whether there is a term of this, till I accidentally found it! These sounds of wind in the trees and the rustling of leaves is called psithurism. Like many words that begin with "ps," the "p" at the beginning of psithurism is silent, and it is pronounced as sith-err-iz-um. It has its origins from the Greek word psithuros, which means whispering. So appropriate!.
Psithurism has inspired  the muse in many. For instance Woody Guthrie (whose birthday is today), wrote a song ‘Listening To The Wind That Blows’:
Blow, wind, blow, long low and lonesome
Blow, wind, blow, where no heart knows
I'm your lonesome-hearted listener
Listening to that lonesome wind that blows
It is easy to have a feel of psithurism. Keep the mouth closed, stick the tongue a bit and make hissing sound, then slowly withdraw the tongue till it touches the teeth, keep the lips closed and let out the air. Close your eyes and keep repeating it and you will be in the midst of a swaying forest!
14/07/23, 5:35 pm - Nalini N R: Virtual tour Sir while enjoying the feel of psithurism😊

17/07/23, 8:46 am - Dr Raguram: When I joined NIMHANS, Dr RL Kapur gave us a few introductory classes on scientific method of enquiry in understanding human behaviour, which invariably, is complex. In the process, he introduced us to the writings of Henri Poincare, whose death anniversary is today. He quoted Poincare about the role of facts in science, “Science is built up of facts, as a house is with stones. But a collection of facts is no more a science than a heap of stones is a house.” Science is the process of determining which of the countless facts will be most useful in advancing knowledge. 
According to Poincare, every scientific theory is a hypothesis that had to be tested. He emphasized that experience alone is inadequate to falsify a theory and the role of falsified hypothesis is very important in any scientific pursuit. 
Poincare also drew attention to the role of intuition in science, “Pure logic cannot give us this view of the whole; it is to intuition that we must look for it. It is with logic that one proves; it is with intuition that one invents.”
I find this particular reflection of his quite interesting: “Life is only a short episode between two eternities and in this episode, conscious thought has lasted and will last only a moment. Thought is only a gleam in the midst of a long night. But it is the gleam which is everything”.
Dr Raguram
17/07/23, 10:25 pm - Nalini N R: Thank you Sir for the glimpse of Poincare's reflections. I think we should develop that bent of mind to go beyond hard facts and that requires acumen. The emphasis on thought, impermanence but it's impact!

19/07/23, 10:22 am - Dr Raguram: Today is the birth anniversary of a poet who was ahead of her times, Balamani Amma. 
On this day, I want to share a poem of hers titled ‘The Pen’ which has been translated by her talented daughter, poet Kamala Das. 
When I touch you, O pen,
you flow like blood in my veins.
You become my lover,
the one who knows my heart’s pain.
You are my companion,
the one who hears my silent cries.
With your ink, you write my story,
and my deepest desires arise.
You understand my words,
even before they are born.
You give life to my thoughts,
like the first light of morn.
You are my confidant,
the keeper of my secrets untold.
You hold my dreams and hopes,
more precious than silver or gold.
When I caress you, O pen,
I feel the pulse of life.
You become my voice,
in a world filled with strife.
You are my solace,
when darkness engulfs my soul.
With your gentle touch,
you make me feel whole.
When I hold you, O pen,
my spirit begins to soar.
You guide me through the realms,
where imagination and dreams explore.
You are my muse,
my source of inspiration divine.
With you by my side,
I can conquer mountains and cross every line.
O pen, you are my magic wand,
that brings forth a world unknown.
Through your ink, I find freedom,
and my true self is shown.
In your strokes and curves,
my heart finds solace and peace.
You are my silent companion,
in this journey that’ll never cease.

26/07/23, 11:33 am - Dr Raguram: There is always a hidden side in each one of us. It is a part of our self which we do not like or acknowledge. It consists of everything that does not align with our conscious self. CG Jung whose birthday is today, termed it as the ‘shadow’ and emphasized that it offers a doorway to understand ourselves. The shadow is a cognitive blind spot of our psyche and Jung described it as “the thing a person has no wish to be”.
Often we identify and respond to the shadow of the others, with ease. It is a truism that what we dislike in others is an indication of what we dislike in ourselves. We hide our negative qualities, not only from others but from ourselves too. 
The meeting with oneself is, at first, the meeting with one’s own shadow. Prising apart the doors of shadow offers us a glimpse of that part of our personality that conflicts with the ideal version of ourselves. It is the first step towards increasing our awareness about our self.  As Jung commented, “one must learn to know oneself in order to know who one is… one does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious” 
Unravelling and working through the shadow is a crucial component in therapy. As Jung commented, “There is no generally effective technique for assimilating the shadow. It is more like diplomacy or statesmanship and it is always an individual matter. First one has to accept and take seriously the existence of the shadow. Second, one has to become aware of its qualities and intentions. This happens through conscientious attention to moods, fantasies and impulses. Third, a long process of negotiation is unavoidable.” 
Jung went on to add, “the task in life is not to become perfect, but to become whole. And as wholeness entails both good and evil, light and darkness, the achievement of wholeness in personality development requires we assimilate our shadow into our conscious personality.”
William Shakespeare articulated it perceptively, “This thing of darkness I acknowledge mine.”
26/07/23, 12:57 pm - Dr Raguram: I was looking for an appropriate photo of mine to go aling with the post and found this one. It is a small steel figure of a man on my desk, casting its shadow in the morning sun

27/07/23, 8:13 am - Dr Raguram: The sentence “A Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose” was written by Gertrude Stein (whose death anniversary is today), as part of a poem ‘Sacred Emily’, which appeared in her 1922 book ‘Geography and Plays’. It is in similar vein to Shakespeare's “a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.” Stein later used variations on the sentence in other writings, and “A rose is a rose is a rose” is among her most famous quotations, often interpreted as meaning “things are what they are.” 
Puzzled by her writing about a rose, someone asked here, ‘Why have you said this? We all know a rose is a rose is a rose. It makes no sense. It adds nothing to our knowledge.’ Stein replied, ‘Because poets have been talking about roses for millennia – millions of poetries about roses, everybody has read them and sung them, and everybody has repeated – the word “rose” has lost its rosiness. It doesn’t say anything anymore. That’s why I had to repeat, “A rose is a rose is a rose” – so that you are awakened out of your sleep, so that you are shaken a little: “What is this woman saying? the absurdity of it! – a rose is a rose is a rose. Repeating this I have brought the redness to the rose again.”
27/07/23, 10:49 pm - Nalini N R: Wow what a photograph Sir👌Acceptance of oneself is a long process. But worth the effort as it loosens the knots.

28/07/23, 8:59 am - Dr Raguram: Matsuo Basho (1644-1694), was Japan's most famous poet, most renowned for his haikus. Born into a samurai family, he was deeply drawn into poetry and gave up his ambitions to be a samurai. He was a wanderer and made several long journeys, writing haikus on the way. The journeys were as much forays into interior as exterior, reflecting his abiding spiritual quest. In 1694, Basho set off on his last journey to his birthplace where he wrote his final poem: 
Stricken while journeying
my dreams still wander about
but on withered fields

29/07/23, 7:41 am - Dr Raguram: It was a misty morning and the jungle was coming alive with bird calls. We were on a jeep cruising along the dusty road. I was busy scouting around for birds with the binoculars and Ahalya nudged me gently to look ahead. And there it was, the majestic beast of the forest. There is nothing like the thrill of watching a tiger as it strides nonchalantly in its lair.
In the words of William Blake:
Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
In the forest of the night,
What immortal hand or eye,
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

03/08/23, 12:54 pm - Dr Raguram: Today is the festival of Aadi Perukku, which marks the beginning of agricultural activities in Tamil Nadu, when the river Kaveri is in full flow due to south west monsoon. Farmers start their sowing in the month of Aadi (July-August) so that they can harvest the crops after six months in January during Pongal Festival. On this day people gather on the banks of Kaveri and offer prayers to the river goddess.  
River Kaveri fostered civilisations, kingdoms rose on her banks and majestic temples were built on the lands irrigated by it. Great Carnatic composers, scholars and writers lived and wrote in the towns and villages that flanked the river. Sangam poetry and tamil epics like Silappadikaram, celebrated her beauty. 
In Pattina Palai, a Tamil poetic work belonging to the Sangam period, Kaveri is referred to as
“Cauvery, the river that never fails, even if the sky does”.
“வான் பொய்ப்பினும் தான் பொய்யா மலைத்தலைய கடற் காவிரி”
An interesting verse in Purananooru, one of the eight books in the Sangam literature, draws attention to the maternal instincts of the river. 
“The forceful waters of the river Cauvery
That can even uproot a tree, 
Takes care of all the living beings of the world
As a woman feeding a child through her breast” 
“புனிறு நீர் குழவிக்கு இலிற்றுமுலை போலச்
சுரந்த காவிரி மரங்கொல் மலி நீர்
மன்பதை புரக்கும்” 
Ilango Adigal wrote in a similar vein in Silappadigaram:
வாழி அவன்தன் வளநாடு
மகவாய்  வளர்க்கும் தாயாகி
ஊழி உய்க்கும் பேருதவி
ஒழியாய் வாழி காவேரி
Long live this fertile country!
Long live Kaveri

13/08/23, 7:23 pm - Dr Raguram: Seychelles has a few endemic species. Prominent among them is the Aldabra giant tortoise. They are found in the Aldabra Atoll of Seychelles, in the western Indian Ocean and were introduced to the mainland, later. These giant tortoises are the largest living terrestrial species of tortoises. 
We set our eyes on these incredible creatures when they were ambling along slowly, in the afternoon sun. Interestingly, the Aldabra giant tortoises are polygynandrous (promiscuous), with both males and females having multiple partners. One criterion for selection is a partner’s relatively bigger size. Like other tortoises, this species does not care for its young once the eggs are laid in a safe nest, with the young hatching and digging out of the nest by themselves. An Aldabra giant tortoise is a very slow-growing reptile and often does not reach maturity until 20-30 years old and live longer than most animals. One of them was brought from Seychelles by the British sailors to India as a gift to Robert Clive of the British East India Company. It was Robert Clive’s pet and was later kept in the Kolkata Zoo where it died after an estimated age of 255! Named ‘Adwaita’, it outlived its master, perhaps knowing all along that the sun would set on the British empire and it would be there to witness it!

14/08/23, 12:03 pm - Dr Raguram: Oriental garden lizards have been around with us for decades. They serve a very useful function as bioregulators of crop pests. One can spot them easily and it is fascinating to watch when they attack a prey. They will wait patiently, sitting on a branch, scanning around for a suitable prey. Once they spot them, they sprint fast to grasp the prey, in a flash.  It is interesting to note that these reptiles are tetrachromats (having four cone cells) which allows them to see colours beyond the normal human visible range and this enhanced colour vision is a significant advantage when they hunt for a prey. 
Lazing in the sun and chasing some insects, it is just another day in the life of the oriental garden lizard!
In its agility

16/08/23, 10:50 am - Dr Raguram: On this day in 1886, during the early morning hours, Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa gave up his body. He has been ailing from throat cancer for a while and was in throes of immense pain. Even swallowing a small quantities of water was intensely painful. Seeing his suffering, his devotees urged him to seek some assistance to lessen the pain, Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa replied, “I have given my mind to the Divine Mother.  How can I bring down my mind to this worthless cage of flesh? The body was born and it will die. But for the soul there is no death.” 
As Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa observed in one of his earlier comments, “Take the case of the infinite ocean. There is no limit to its water. Suppose a pot is immersed in it: there is water both inside and outside the pot. What is this pot? It is 'I-consciousness'. Because of the pot the water appears to be divided into two parts; because of the pot you seem to perceive an inside and an outside. One feels that way as long as this pot of 'I' exists. When the 'I' disappears, what remains cannot be described in words.”
16/08/23, 12:22 pm - Nalini N R: It was so clearly and in very simple words with lot of anecdotes Sri Ramakrihna Paramahamsa explained. All great saints say the same but as it is said we have to raise the sail🙏

19/08/23, 9:39 am - Dr Raguram: This is the first photograph I took, with a borrowed camera, way back when I was an undergraduate student in medicine at JIPMER. Auroville which was not far from our campus, was taking shape with some extraordinary architectural structures. Every weekend, I would cycle with my namesake TM Raghuram and during one such visit, spotted this circular opening in Bharat Nivas.  I then asked TM to stand behind and raise his hand and this photo was the result. 
Photography, like any other form of art is an act of self-expression. We reveal and unravel ourselves through the lens. Perhaps I was envisioning myself while framing the hand of my namesake, which occurred at the spur of the moment, without any forethought. I was both the subject as well as the object of observation.
As Rumi observed, “the real eye is the one that turns inwards” . . .

22/08/23, 10:39 pm - Nalini N R: It is a wonderful photograph Sir!! Looks exactly like an eye eyeball and eyelashes. Trying to fetch something and what a caption. Very creative!! Sorry for the late reaction as I was down with fever.

26/08/23, 11:56 am - Dr Raguram: Buddha was sitting under the Bodhi tree for thirty days and his disciples were sitting all around him, watching. On about the thirtieth day he opened his eyes and he was shining, he was smiling. His disciples asked him, "Master, what happened to you, did you see God?" He said, "No," "Did you become self-realized?" "No," "Well what happened," and he simply exclaimed, "I am awake!"
26/08/23, 8:58 pm - Nalini N R: To be awake... Such a deep meaning. Never to get back to darkness.... The statue of Buddha depicts beautifully!

27/08/23, 9:06 am - Dr Raguram: Today is the birthday of one of the most eminent psychiatrists that India ever produced, Dr Jaswant Singh Neki. As a fledgling young psychiatrist, I cherish the few interactions that I have had whenever he visited NIMHANS. Though I was overawed with his towering presence and intellectual proves, he interacted with youngsters like me with ease. In one such interaction, I asked him about the categorical classification on mental illness and I was bowled over by his response. He said, “Young man, we try to capture the intangible in tangible way. Once we do that, we try to enumerate and quantify the tangible. Not content with it, we then try to measure it. In the process the essence and spirit of the intangible nature of human behaviour is lost.”
Dr JS Neki was a noted poet with several volumes of published work. On another occasion, I asked him about how science and poetry relate to each other. His answer was very apt, “A scientist is an empirical poet and a poet is a scientist of more imaginative and creative hypotheses."
His magnum opus is Koee Naon Na Jane Mera (Nobody Knows even my Name) which is his autobiography written in verse form. Unfortunately, this has not been translated into English. When I searched the net, I found a translation of one of the verses from the first section of the book:
My life is a journal, a diary, in it
I wrote one tale but another got writ.
My fancy built but castles of sand,
My effort drew but lines in brine.
Enrolling my name in destiny's scroll,
A spot I got on the slopes of Time.
27/08/23, 10:22 pm - Nalini N R: It is so True what he talks about classification. Though it may help for a rough understanding of the problem, for scientific study, very important to understand the unique nature of problems the person has... Thank you Sir for the glimpse especially the poetic side.

28/08/23, 8:20 am - Dr Raguram: Bangalore hosted the Filmotsav in 1980 with a remarkable array of films. It marked the 25th anniversary of Satyajit Ray’s Pather Panchali and there was a complete retrospective of the master’s work. One of the films that left a deep impact on me was the documentary ‘King’. When we entered the theatre where it was screened, there was a prominent notice which stated, “no sex, no nudity and the film is 4hrs long!” Not surprisingly, there was hardly a dozen people in the auditorium. What we watched for the next four hours was the life story of Martin Luther King, his trials and tribulations, put together with real life footage. Prominent among them was his epochal speech ‘I have a dream’, delivered at the Lincoln Memorial, Washington.
Today marks the 60th anniversary of that poetic, prophetic, moving call to end segregation. The speech was written by his assistants and did not have the iconic line, ‘I have a dream’. As Martin Luther King was about to end his speech, Mahalia Jackson who was in the audience, shouted, “Tell them about your dream Martin!” And history was made. 
Although six decades have passed since the legendary speech, it still remains an inspirational call to work towards an equitable world. As he voiced in his speech, “Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.”
Though the dreamer laid down his life by an act of hatred, the dream lives on . . .

30/08/23, 10:31 am - Dr Raguram: My grand uncle Dr RV Rajam was a well-known medical professional and a passionate bibliophile. Once when I visited him after joining the medical school, he handed over a slim book and asked me to read it. It was ‘Death Be Not Proud’ by John Gunther. Once I started reading it, I couldn’t put it down. Gunther’s memoir is a moving account of his son Johnny’s tryst with a fast growing brain tumour and his death. 
The book's title comes from one of John Donne's Holy Sonnets, which he wrote after the death of his wife and three of his children. It opens with Gunther's fond, vivid portrait of his son: a young man of extraordinary intellectual promise and fun loving as well. It is a meticulous record of the diagnosis and the exhaustive hunt for various therapeutic options that he and his ex-wife pursued during their son's illness. The second section consists of Johnny’s letters and diaries which offer rich insights about his life before the onset of the tumour. The concluding part of the book by his mother, Frances is an intensely emotional account of a mother coping with the illness and demise of a beloved child. It ends with the moving last line, "And then like a thief, death stole him".
Death Be Not Proud is a poignantly interwoven account of the family’s suffering and loss. It is the forerunner of many others that followed, in articulating lived experiences of grief.
Inherent in personal narratives like Death Be Not Proud, is the immeasurable power of words to heal. The concept of bibliotherapy is not new. In ancient Greece, the phrase “a healing place for the soul” was inscribed above the door to the library of Thebes. In the prescient words of the bard, “Give sorrow words, the grief that does not speak knits up the o’er wrought heart and bids it break.”
For people in throes of grief, poems do offer comfort and solace.
John Milton wrote in 1671:
“apt words have power to swage
The tumours of a troubled mind.
And are as balm to festered wound”
(Today is also the birthday of John Gunther)

01/09/23, 10:15 am - Dr Raguram: Ahalya and myself finally caught up with the movie Oppenheimer and the story about the ‘trinity’ test. The name is derived from a poem by John Donne and perhaps these lines from it “your force, to break, blow, burn and make me new”, were the inspiration behind choosing it. Watching the movie also brought back memories of passing by the testing site on our way to the White Sands National Park, New Mexico. 
As a talented scientist, Oppenheimer ensured that the test was a success. Was he mindful about its radioactive fallout and its hazards? Though he famously remarked that he had blood on his hands, ostensibly, there was neither apology nor guilt about the human cost of the project that he led. During his visit to Japan later, he commented, “I do not think coming to Japan changed my sense of anguish about my part in this whole piece of history. Nor has it fully made me regret my responsibility for the technical success of the enterprise.” The horrendous effect of the bomb on Hiroshima is mentioned in the movie in bland statistical terms couched in numbers. One has to read John Hershey’s ‘Hiroshima’ to fathom the humongous human suffering inflicted by the act.
There were also others who had to endure the lasting effects of radiation around the test site. Often referred to as ‘downwinders’, these were thousands of families living in close proximity to the area. The bomb was packed with 13 pounds of weapons grade plutonium but only 3 pounds of the plutonium was fissioned.  The remaining 10 pounds of plutonium found its way into the soil, sand, animal and plant life and on the skin of every living being.  As a result of the overexposure to radiation, there was an increase in infant mortality in the months following the test. Heart disease, leukaemia, and other cancers appeared in families who had no prior history. Because of illness they were unable to work and access to health care remained unaffordable and elusive. 
Though the US Government set up a fund to extend compensation and medical care through the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), the downwinders in New Mexico have never been included or compensated although they were the first people to be exposed to radiation in the world. 
The poet Tōge Sankichi captured the horror and devastation unleashed by the atom bomb in the poem ‘August 6th’. Here are the first few lines from it:
“can we forget that flash?
suddenly 30,000 in the streets disappeared
in the crushed depths of darkness
the shrieks of 50,000 died out “

02/09/23, 8:23 am - Dr Raguram: Vultures are majestic creatures, almost regal in their demeanour. Whenever I spot them, I think of Bharathidasan. Long ago during a birding sojourn, he spoke to us passionately about them and the importance of their conservation. In 2002, he founded Arulagam, a non-profit organisation dedicated towards their protection and conservation in the Nilagiri Biosphere. He began working with forest officials, persuading them not to bury the carcasses of elephants or gaur found in the forest but to leave them as feed for the vultures. He also started conducting workshops for cattle owners, vets and pharmacists to make them aware about the harmful effects of Diclofenac on vultures. He has been engaging the local communities in identifying and protecting vulture nesting areas. He is truly an inspiration and do have a look at the range of initiatives he is involved in at:  https://www.arulagam.org/
(The first Saturday in September each year is celebrated as the International Vulture Awareness Day)

04/09/23, 10:23 am - Dr Raguram: Decades ago during a visit to the Premier Bookshop, I picked up a book (attracted by its title!), ‘Limits to Medicine’ by Ivan Illich. It blew me away when I read it. I was struck by its originality as well as by its audacity. Illich dared to question some of our deepest-held beliefs about medicine. 
Those days, NIMHANS used to have a book review session and when my turn came, I chose this book without any hesitation. When I mentioned it to Dr RL Kapur, he asked me to meet the visiting professor Dr Morris Carstairs. He asked me the reason why I chose the book and said that he would chair the session. When I was about to leave, he told me that he had had a televised debate with Illich about the book! The session went off very well with me passionately articulating its strengths and drawbacks. After the session when we were walking out, Carstairs shook my hand and said, “You are a wonderful rascal!” A typical British encomium!
One of the major themes in the book is iatrogenesis. Illich described three types of iatrogenesis: clinical, or the direct harm done by various medical treatments; social and the medicalisation of ordinary life; and cultural, meaning the loss of traditional ways of dealing with suffering and death. He coined the term ‘Sisyphus syndrome’, meaning the more healthcare is given to a population, the greater is its demand. He cautioned that over-medicalisation often results in commodification of health and ‘industrialization’ of medical practice.
Illich’s prediction of ever-increasing medicalisation has come true and unfortunately, doctors are as much victims of it as their patients. Health care is now on this conveyor belt, driven by ‘targets’ set by ‘managers’ who have no background in medicine, solely driven by market forces. Doctors no longer hold the monopoly and they are “accomplices” in the ever expanding, large medical industry.  
Illich was a visionary in the proper sense. He drew attention to disease mongering and the increasing pharmaceutical invasion.  He emphasized the importance of evidence base in the practice of medicine and the crucial role of community and public involvement in medical care.  
He mentioned that “if you want to change society then you must tell an alternative story” and ‘Limits to Medicine’ is a provocative one at that!
(Today is Ivan Illich’s birthday)

06/09/23, 8:14 am - Dr Raguram: Hindu mythology is replete with many interesting stories and legends. Some of the fascinating ones are associated with Lord Krishna and his early childhood pranks. Among them Kaalinga Narthanam episode is quite fascinating.
Kaalinga was a serpent who was living in the Yamuna river in Vrindavan and had poisoned the entire river thus making it very difficult for people and animals to consume the water. He was hiding there from Garuda, his eternal enemy. Once Krishna jumped into the river to retrieve a ball and Kaalinga immediately tried to kill him. Krishna sprang on top of Kalinga’s head and started dancing on his hood. He spared Kaalinga at the behest of his wives and Kaalinga agreed to go back to his abode as he felt reassured that with the foot marks of Krishna on his hood Garuda would hesitate to harm him. 
Many hymns and songs have been composed in celebration of this event. 
Periyazhwar in his ‘Periyazhwar Thirumozhi’ wrote: 
காளியன் பொய்கை கலங்கப் பாய்ந்திட்டு 
அவன் நீள்முடியைந்திலும் நின்று நடம்செய்து
மீள அவனுக்கு அருள் செய்த வித்தகன்
தோள்வலி வீரமே பாடிப்பற  தூமணி வண்ணனைப் பாடிப்பற.
Another interesting song was composed by Oothukadu Venkata Subbaiyer. He was a devotee of Lord Krishna, and is believed to have composed over 400 compositions on Him.  In the Kaalinga Narthana thillana, he describes the dance of the young Krishna on the hoods of the serpent. It contains many rhythmic words and intricate sequences that are fused with repetitive musical notes. He had even set the singing style in such a way that, at one place, a particular word is enunciated to resemble the hissing sound made by the great serpent! 
Neela manohara jaala vibhooshana
Nirata chalanchala bhujanga nartana
Neeraja taDaaga adika mrudulapada
NikaTa taranga tunga tADanga
Nruttaka nruttaka taam tat taai 
The beautiful blue-coloured one, embellished by his enchantment,
Is dancing on the tumultuously moving serpent
With footsteps softer than lotus petals
On the turbulent waves, adorned by drops of water
He dances and dances.
One of the most energetic rendering of this thillana is by Aruna Sayiram!

10/09/23, 10:31 am - Dr Raguram: The beauty of the natural world has inspired people from the beginning of time, especially the poets. A tiny grain of sand inspired William Blake to pen these lines, “To see the world in a grain of sand / And heaven in a wild flower / To hold infinity in the palm of your hand / And eternity in an hour”. Whether it is a grain of sand, alluring landscapes or changing seasons, the urge to describe the natural world has been an inescapable of poetry.
I am particularly drawn to the poems of Mary Oliver whose birthday is today.  Through carefully chiselled words, she painted exquisite pictures of the natural world in her works. For her, nature was a source solace and wisdom. She wrote, “I could not be a poet without the natural world. Someone else could. But not me. For me, the door to the woods is the door to the temple.” 
These eloquent lines from her poem ‘Wild Geese’ are truly exceptional: 
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air
are heading home again
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
the world offers itself to your imagination,
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting
over and over announcing your place
in the family of things
Dr Raguram
10/09/23, 10:11 pm - Nalini N R: Mary Oliver's words remind me of Rashtra Kavi Kuvempu's words, Kai mugidu olage ba idu sasya kashi which is the welcome board on the arch of Lalbagh. Minute observations of nature have inspired the poets! There is do much clarity in the photograph!!

12/09/23, 8:44 am - Dr Raguram: The movie Pather Panchali has had an enduring impact on me. I have seen it at least half a dozen times and each and every scene is deeply etched in memory. The most endearing characters in the movie are drawn from the novel written by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, whose birthday is today. Satyajit Ray went on to make more movies based on his work.
A not so well known novel of Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay is Aranyak. A newer translation was published by Penguin Modern Classics, two years ago. It is a heart-warming story of Satyacharan who gets a job as an estate manager in Bihar, and gradually falls in love with the beautiful and tranquil forest around him. It is a great environmental text celebrating the pristine beauty of nature, essaying the deep attachment of people who live close to mother earth. As one of the characters mentions, “The forest you see here is very beautiful. The flowers have been blooming since a long time and the birds sing. Each with their own call; the gods themselves have merged with the wind and have left their mark on the earth. ..So whenever I pick up the cutter and the axe, the gods come and snatch away my tools. They whisper such thoughts into my ears that all thoughts of land and property are driven away from my mind”. 
Living amongst them and listening to their stories, Satyacharan becomes a nature lover, “I had come here to settle new tenants in these forests. Having come to destroy the forestland, I have instead fallen in love with the beautiful forest maid”. He goes on to observe, “I shall try in vain to describe the beauty of a full-moon night in Phulkiya Baihar. Anybody who does not have the first-hand experience will never be able to imagine its beauty by merely listening or reading about it. Such a world of exquisite beauty can be manifested only in a place with such vastness of the sky, such quietude, such solitude, such dense vegetation spread up to the horizon. One should experience the beauty of such a place at least once in one’s lifetime; or else such a unique beauty of God’s creation will elude one forever.”
Feeling uneasy about the impending deforestation of the pristine land, Satyacharan laments, “Perhaps a time would come when men would no more be able to see forests: all they would see would be fields of crops, or the chimneys of jute and cotton mills. They would come then to this secluded forest-land, as though on a pilgrimage. For those people, yet to come, let the forest stay pristine, undisturbed.”
These words seem almost prophetic in light of the recent amendments to the Forest Act which opens up swathes of forests for ‘developmental’ activities.
It is disheartening to note that we still have not paid heed to Satyacharan’s poignant words…

15/09/23, 8:10 am - Dr Raguram: We have been planning to visit the newly opened Museum of Art and Photography (MAP) for a while and finally made it a few days ago.
It is a beautifully designed, aesthetically appealing structure and a welcome addition to the city. The main reason to visit the museum was to see the current exhibition, ‘With Great Ease: The Photography of TS Satyan’. Satyan has been a very close friend and we cherish the photographs which he so graciously gifted to us. They have a special place in our home and in our hearts. The exhibition offers a tantalizing glimpse of his remarkable oeuvre. Satyan’s family has donated his vast archive of photographs, negatives, and writings to the Museum of Art & Photography and this exhibition draws from that collection. As Satyan remarked, “My photography are slices of human life, gentle and personal” and I would urge people based in Bangalore to visit and have a glimpse of these wonderful images.
The other exhibition Visible/Invisible is a bit uneven, but has some interesting exhibits.
There is a very interesting hologram experience, wherein one can chat with MF Husain!
Two things bothered me about the museum…
Firstly there is no parking at all in the museum and one has to venture into the by lanes and search for one, which can be elusive. I wonder how the license was sanctioned for a new structure like this which will attract large footfall, without a dedicated parking space. That said, I noticed that a VIP visitor’s vehicle with the police escort was parked just in front of the museum which had a prominent board saying No Parking!
Secondly, why do the prices in the museum shop be so high?! I am personally in favour of ‘affordable’ art which can kindle the aesthetic spirit among the visitors!

There is an interesting story behind this song. I understand that it was inspired by a gramophone record ‘Toot Gayi Man Bina’, sung by Sheela Sarkar and set to music by Kamal Dasgupta. You can listen to the song here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2dqWwJYs6E.

17/09/23, 10:36 am - Dr Raguram: Wild boars have been an integral part of the Indian ecosystem and have been mentioned in various folklores and mythologies. Among them, one of the most prominent reference to the wild boars is that of Varaha, the third avatar of Vishnu. It is a fascinating tale of how the earth goddess Bhudevi was captured by the demon Hiranayaksha and trapped in the cosmic waters. Vishnu then took the form of a divine boar and rescued her after battling the demon for a thousand years.
Varaha worship was significant in Central India during the Gupta period, particularly from the 4th to the 6th century CE. The worship of Varaha was also important in southern India, especially during the early Chalukyan period. They were the first dynasty to adopt boar as their symbol. Later the Vijayanagar dynasty also chose the boar as their royal emblem
In sculptural tradition, Varaha is usually depicted in two distinct ways: one is with the head of a boar and torso of a man, which is called the ‘Naravaraha’, and the other as a wild boar. Khajuraho has one of the best-known representations of Varaha in the wild boar form. One of the most beautiful depictions of Varaha as ‘Naravaraha’, is at the Mahakuta temple which dates back to 5th-6th centry.  
Varaha avatar symbolizes the preservation and restoration of the world and the triumph of good over evil. Today, when our earth faces a serious threat from several modern demons, the chief of which is our own endless greed, it’s time to feel inspired by Varaha! 
(Today is also celebrated as Varaha Jayanthi)

18/09/23, 9:58 am - Dr Raguram: The Brahmapurisvara temple at Pullamangai, built in 10 century, is an extraordinary example of early Chola temple architecture. On this day, let me draw attention to an exquisite sculpture of Ganesha which is carved on the southern wall of the shrine. The god is seated on a throne with folded legs. His trunk hangs vertically and then curves to the left in the form of an inverted question mark.  Ganesha is covered by a beautifully sculpted parasol with a central pendant. Two saluting figures are shown in flying posture on either side. Ganesha, ‘Lord of the Ganas’, is flanked by joyous Ganas in three superimposed rows. One of them is holding Ganesha’s vahana (vehicle) Mushaka (Mouse).  Right on top is the Makara Torana, with two Makaras carved on either side. Rows of Yalis, some of them with human riders, emerge from the mouth of the Makaras and form a canopy. Right in the middle of the canopy is a dancing figure (Siva?). Below it is another row of Ganas. In the midst of this elaborately carved canopy is a very small sculpture which depicts Siva, Parvati and Chandesa Nayanar. There is a large, beautifully carved sculpture of Chandesa Anugraha Murti in Gangaikondacholapuram. This one is a miniature depiction of it, much earlier! Kindly enlarge the image to see these intricate details!
May our lives be suffused with such beauty in its myriad forms!

23/09/23, 8:41 am - Dr Raguram: During my tenure at NIMHANS, I used to conduct what was referred to as ‘Brain Storming Session’, on Saturdays. The idea was to broaden the ‘clinical gaze’ which the trainees are accustomed to and discuss issues of interest, whether it is a book/poem/film they have read/seen recently or explore an issue of concern. The unwritten rule was that no topic related to mental health will ever be the focus of discussion in the forum.
In one of the sessions, a visiting student from Sweden brought a book of poems by Pablo Neruda and recited some of them. I can distinctly recollect a few lines from one of the poems ‘Keeping Quiet.’: 
“For once on the face of the earth
let’s not speak in any language,
let’s stop for one second,
and not move our arms so much.
It would be an exotic moment
without rush, without engines,
we would all be together
in a sudden strangeness…”
The session ended with some lively discussion about Neruda and his poems and I also urged the students to see the movie, ‘il Postino (The Postman)’. It portrays an imagined a fictional friendship between Pablo Neruda and a shy impressionable young postman named Mario. Pablo Neruda has been exiled from his native Chile for political reasons, and has come to live in a small village. The entire village is illiterate and he’s the only one getting mail. After some hesitation, Mario summons up the courage to talk to Neruda. They talk about poetry, politics and women. Mario and Pablo develop a deep friendship as time passes. All these elements flow together seamlessly in a fascinating manner in the movie. More than anything else the movie is about the power of language. As Mario comments to Neruda, “You gave me books to read, you taught me to use my tongue for more than licking stamps.” 
(Today is Pablo Neruda’s 50th death anniversary)

24/09/23, 9:50 am - Dr Raguram: When we were birding in the Point Reyes region CA, I heard a faint, warbling call. Curious to know the source of it, I scouted the vast land in front, but in vain. Suddenly, there was a flash of luminous blue and there it was, the Western Bluebird perched on the thorny bush! It was carrying the azure sky on its back. I spent a few minutes savouring this beauty. Bluebirds are friends to gardeners because they keep plant-damaging insects and other pests at bay and they can spot them from a distance of over 50 yards!
Bluebird is considered to be a harbinger of happiness. This notion was first held by the Chinese who saw the bird as immortal, a protector, and a symbol of the sun. Native Americans too were in deep awe of the bluebird. Navajos revered it as a spirit in animal form, and the Iroquois believed the bluebird’s song would make the harsh winters bearable. For the Russians, the bluebird represented hope. 
Bluebirds figure in many lovely songs. In 1934, the song ‘Bluebird of Happiness’ was composed by Sandor Harmati and the words were written by Edward Heyman. By 1945, the song had become an international hit. Many other bluebird songs followed, including Judy Garland’s ‘Hello, Bluebird’ and Paul McCartney’s ‘Bluebird.’ Who can forget these lines from the  song ‘Over The Rainbow’ in the movie Wizard of Oz: 
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?
23rd September is considered as the ‘Bluebird of Happiness Day!’

25/09/23, 8:47 am - Dr Raguram: Equinox in the Northern Hemisphere heralds the advent of autumn. It is the time of the year when the trees that were once green explode into beautiful hues of gold, red, and orange. It is a beautiful sight to see the autumn leaves glide gently in the wind and fall as if they are falling in love with the earth. 
Autumn teaches us that letting go is part of growing up. As Virginia Wolf wrote, "And all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be are full of trees and changing leaves..."
25/09/23, 10:30 pm - Nalini N R: It really looks like bluebird of happiness day. A small one yet so popular!!

When we burrow deep within ourselves, the inner landscape unfolds, offering a glimpse of the potentials and challenges within. It may not be an easy task. As we diligently busy ourselves, like the crab shovelling each layer, the richness and depth of our self, unfolds. 
Embrace the process of burrowing and discover yourself…it is like coming home.

30/09/23, 10:22 am - Dr Raguram: I never get tired of reading Rumi, whose birthday is today. His insightful words and verses about life, love and unity of spirit touches me deeply. There is so much spiritual wisdom in his writings. He was an independent soul yearning for true freedom from dogma and hypocrisy and wrote about the abolishment of fear based religious orders. His prime message is that God is found in your own heart; “Every moment I shape my destiny with a chisel. I am a carpenter of my own soul.”
He articulated a notion of a "religion of love," and wrote that "since we worship the one God/ Then all religions must be one." Remarkably at his funeral in Konya, Turkey, in 1273, the procession included not only singers and dancers, besides the traditional chanting from the Quran, but also there were Christian priests chanting the Gospel and Jewish rabbis reciting Psalms.
Just before his death, he recited one of his most inspirational words;
“When I die; when my coffin is being taken out
you must never think I am missing this world.
Don't shed any tears, don't lament or feel sorry. I'm not falling into a monster's abyss.
When you see my corpse is being carried,
don’t cry for my leaving.
I'm not leaving; I'm arriving at eternal love.
When you leave me in the grave, don't say goodbye.
Remember a grave is only a curtain for the paradise behind.
You'll only see me descending into a grave, now watch me rise.
How can there be an end? When the sun sets
or the moon goes down, it looks like the end,
It seems like a sunset, but in reality, it is dawn.
When the grave locks you up, that is when your soul is freed.
Have you ever seen a seed fallen to earth not rise with a new life?
Why should you doubt the rise of a seed named man?. . .
When, for the last time, you close your mouth,
Your words and soul will belong to the world of no place, no time.”
And these words are inscribed in his tomb;
“When we are dead, seek not our tomb in the earth, but find it in the hearts of men“.

01/10/23, 10:27 am - Dr Raguram: On this World Elderly Day, let me recall Shakespeare’s evocative, lyrical verse on ageing.
Sonnet 73: That Time Of Year Thou Mayst In Me Behold
That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
In me thou see’st the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west;
Which by and by black night doth take away,
Death’s second self, that seals up all in rest.
In me thou see’st the glowing of such fire,
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
Consum’d with that which it was nourish’d by.
This thou perceiv’st, which makes thy love more strong,
To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.
The temple at Thiruppudaimaruthur is a treasure trove. Amidst beautiful murals that adorn the interior of the main gopuram, there are small, intricately carved wooden sculptures, like this one of an elderly person.

06/10/23, 9:05 am - Dr Raguram: There is a mystery about rivers that inspires poets. Alfred Tennyson, (whose death anniversary is today), was no exception and wrote a wonderful poem, ‘The Brook’. It was written six years before his death. The poem narrates the journey of a brook as it flows over hills and by villages, seeing various sights on its way, to ultimately join the river. The premise of the poem is that our lives are like rivers which are sometime peaceful, other times turbulent. We drift along, occasionally tossed over by the rapids. When we finally merge with the river and then the vast ocean, there is no end but a new beginning. The poem ends with these  beautiful lines: 
And out again I curve and flow
To join the brimming river,
For men may come and men may go,
But I go on for ever.

07/10/23, 9:54 am - Dr Raguram: Smile made its appearance first in sculptures during the Archaic Period in 6th -7th century BC. The characteristic smile on Greek statues was often referred to as the Archaic smile. It was believed that this kind of smile reflected a state of ideal health and well-being. The goddess Aphrodite, one of the 12 Greek Olympian gods, was called “lover of smiles”.
Closer home, smiling visages started appearing in sculptures, especially that of Buddha during the Gupta period. Bharatha in Natyashashtra  described two forms of smile.
īṣadvikasitair gaṇḍaiḥ kaṭākṣaiḥ sauṣṭhavānvitaiḥ
alakṣitadvijaṃ dhīram uttamānāṃ smitaṃ bhavet || 54 |
“With cheeks slightly expanded, with glances of perfect qualities, not showing the teeth, stable, should be the smile (smita) of the highest characters.” 54
utphullānananetraṃ yad gaṇḍair vikasitair atha
kiṃcillakṣitadantaṃ ca hasitaṃ tad vidhīyate || 55 || 
“That which blooms the mouth and the eyes, expands the cheeks, shows the teeth slightly, is prescribed as smile (hasita).” 55
I was looking at my library of images to locate a sculpture which depicts ‘smita’ and this particular one from Khajuraho seemed to represent the description of Bharatha, closely. The smile on the face of this alluring maiden is so well delineated with elongations of the ends of the line of joined lips, slightly swollen cheeks and enlarged nostril base. The almond-shaped eyes are almost on a level with the cheeks and brows, giving an expression of tenderness and bliss. 
A smile
Though frozen in time
Still enchants

07/10/23, 2:49 pm - Nalini N R: Oh God... No wonder there is A Day for smile. As it seems to be disappearing rapidly in the present society. So beautifully sculpted as it is not easy to chisel the emotion. It does bring a smile on the face of the onlooker😊

08/10/23, 10:25 am - Dr Raguram: Munshi Premchand (whose death anniversary is today), is often referred to as ‘qalam ka sipahi’, soldier of the pen. His first collection of five short stories, Soz-e Watan was considered seditious and copies were burnt by the then government. Undeterred by this, he changed his name and continued to write. He wrote more than 300 short stories, plays, translations and14 novels.
Godaan is his magnum opus. It is the story of Hari, a poor farmer and his family’s struggle for survival and self-respect. Hari does everything he can to fulfil his life’s desire: to own a cow, as he believes that making the gift of a cow to a Brahman before he dies will help him achieve salvation. Premchand casts his glance beyond Hari to a far wider canvas with many interwoven stories. It is a deeply political novel which essays the lives and plights of the rural poor with much sensitivity. Almost everyone in the village is deep in debt – which keeps growing. As one of the farmer laments:
“Our parasitic existence has crippled us. (...) Sometimes I think the government would do us a big favour by confiscating our lands and making us work for a living. (...) We've fallen prey to the system, a system that's completely destroying us. Until we're freed from the chains of wealth, the curse will keep hanging over our heads and we'll never reach those heights of manhood which are life's ultimate goal”.
Even decades later, nothing seems to have changed in farmers’ lives in India.
Godaan was the final work of Premchand. It was also the last book translated by my mother when she was in throes of a ravaging illness. It was a daunting task which she completed with unflinching resolve which is aptly summarized in these words in Godaan:
“लिखते तो वह लोग हैं, जिनके अंदर कुछ दर्द है, अनुराग है, लगन है, विचार है। 
“Those people who write are those who have some pain, affection, dedication and thoughts”.

09/10/23, 8:08 am - Dr Raguram: Beatles had a very productive sojourn in Rishikesh with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, penning several beautiful songs. One day the Maharishi gave a lecture about the power of nature and the cycle of life comparing it to the cycle of human nature. Both John and Paul were inspired by his words. John wrote ‘Child of Nature’ and Paul came up with ‘Mother Nature’s Son’. When John heard Paul’s song he felt it captured what he wanted to say better and ‘Child of Nature’, did not figure in any of Beatles albums. It was released as part of the so called Esher demos. Much later, Lennon wrote a song ‘Jealous Guy’, with exactly the same melody but with completely different lyrics. 
Although not as well-known as Lennon’s other songs, it has a lingering beauty:
On the road to Rishikesh
I was dreaming more or less
And the dream I had was true
Yes, the dream I had was true
I’m just a child of nature
I don’t need much to set me free
I’m just child of nature
I’m one of nature’s children
Sunlight shining in your eyes
As I face the desert skies
And my thoughts return to home
Yes, my thoughts return to home
I’m just a child of nature
I don’t need much to set me free
I’m just a child of nature
I’m one nature’s children
Underneath the mountain ranges
Where the wind that never changes
Touch the windows of my soul
Touch the windows of my soul
I’m just a child of nature
I don’t need much to set me free
I’m just a child of nature

10/10/23, 9:56 am - Dr Raguram: Can being around with birds improve mental health?
New research from King’s College London has found that seeing or hearing birds is associated with an improvement in mental well-being and this improvement was also evident in people with a diagnosis of depression, indicating the potential role of birdlife in helping those with mental health conditions. It was also noticed that people living in neighbourhoods with more birds are less likely to suffer from depression, anxiety and stress. By contrast, listening to more traffic noise worsened symptoms of depressive states.
Birds connect us to nature and the mere act of watching and listening to their calls can soothe our minds in a stressful world. 
Go out and be amidst them. And even if they are hidden in trees or lurking in the underbrush, do revel in their songs. When they take to their wings, let your mind soar along with them…
(On World Mental Health Day!)
Dr Raguram
10/10/23, 10:37 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. The very sound of the bird's song early morning is enough to start the day in a positive way.

11/10/23, 7:12 am - Dr Raguram: Yesterday was the birthday of Kota Shivarama Karanth. He was a trendsetter in many areas and left an indelible mark in each of them. An unknown facet of his remarkable literary oeuvre is his interest in science fiction. He wrote a story ‘Pashubala’ in 1928, perhaps the science fiction in Kannada. The story revolves around two friends who are convinced that there is life in Mars and work on a manned mission with the help of a group of scientists. When they land in Mercury, they find humanoid aliens living in harmony with nature. Interestingly, one of the gadgets mentioned is, ‘tejobhaashaka’ which can communicate across light years. Truly a visionary!
You can find the only English translation of this intriguing story here: https://schrodingersbekku.blogspot.com/2020/10/pashubala-by-k-shivarama-karanth.html.

15/10/23, 12:44 pm - Dr Raguram: Poets often feel alienated and estranged which they express in their works which are deeply moving. Sylivia Plath was once such poet whose poems left a lasting impact on me. When I was reading the poems of Louise Gluck (who passed away a few days ago), I was struck by the similarity between her verses and that of Sylvia Plath (who is my favourite poet!). There is an unmistakable, intimate, autobiographical tone in her works much like Sylvia Plath. Like Plath, Louise Glück explores the deepest, innermost feelings in simple, straightforward language. In the poem ‘Nostos’, she penned these memorable lines:
We look at the world once, in childhood.
The rest is memory..
In many of her poems, Lousie Gluck drew attention to the intimate association between humans and nature. For instance, in the poem, ‘October’, she wrote:
What others found in art
I found in nature.
What others found in human love
I found in nature.
Very simple.
These lines reiterate my belief that nature can assist and guide us in discovering our own inner selves...
Dr Raguram
15/10/23, 7:02 pm - Nalini N R: Awesome photograph Sir. It is so soothing and only poets can catch the experience and convey in words. But what we accept in nature for its ups and downs, people fail to do so in humans.

18/10/23, 10:02 am - Dr Raguram: Our lives seldom turn out to be the way that we want it to be. As Lao Tzu said 2500 years ago, “Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don’t resist them—that only creates sorrow. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.” As we flow in the river of our lives there are fleeting moments when we come close to ourselves and feel at home. These experiences are incredibly intense and indescribable. 
Such personal experiences form the core of Zen. The teachings of Zen focus on these moments. Zen has no God to worship, no ceremonial rites to observe. It does not attach any intrinsic importance to the sacred sutras or to their exegeses by the wise and learned. 
The first book to cogently outline basic premises of Zen way of life, ‘Introduction to Zen Buddhism’, was authored by D T Suzuki (whose birthday is today) in 1927. Carl Jung wrote a lucid foreword introducing the tenets of Zen and locating it in the larger framework of Buddhist thought. 
As Suzuki writes in the book, “Zen teaches nothing; it merely enables us to wake up and become aware. It does not teach, it points.” 
There is so much wisdom in these words of Suzuki, “Unless it grows out of yourself no knowledge is really yours, it is only borrowed plumage.”

19/10/23, 7:47 am - Dr Raguram: Sometime back, I read the book, ‘Truth and Beauty: Aesthetics and Motivations In Science' by the Nobel laureate Dr S Chandrasekhar. It is a collection of speeches he delivered over 40 years on the questions of how scientists work and what motivates their quest. The most insightful lecture in the volume is the one in which he compares the work of Shakespeare, Beethoven and Newton. I was truly amazed at the depth and vastness of his erudition. CP Snow famously referred the relationship between the culture of sciences and that of the humanities as the ‘Two Cultures’. Chandrasekhar engages both these worlds with seamless elegance.
He comments, “To me, science is the search for truth, a definitive repetitive pattern in creation...Mozart looked for it in music, Monet saw it in a haystack he painted, Michelangelo found it in stone... Perhaps a scientist seeks it through a mathematical equation. But we can all see only a part of the pattern at a time. It is given only to a few to see the whole."
Writing on the quest of science, he comments, “The pursuit of science has often been compared to the scaling of mountains, high and not so high. But who among us can hope, even in imagination, to scale Everest and reach its summit when the sky is blue and the air is still, and in the stillness of the air survey the entire Himalayan range in the dazzling white of the snow stretching to infinity? None of us can hope for a comparable vision of nature and of the universe around us. But there is nothing mean or lowly in standing in the valley below and awaiting the sun to rise over Kinchinjunga”. 
Here was a scientist who spoke like a poet.

Michael R. Burch wrote these poignant lines for us to reflect on this dastardly act:
Where does the butterfly go
when mothers cry
while children die
and politicians lie, politicians lie?
When the darkness of grief blots out all that we know:
when love and life are running low,
where does the butterfly go?
And how shall the spirit take wing
when life is harsh, too harsh to face,
and hope is flown without a trace?
Oh, when the light of life runs low,
where does the butterfly go,
where does the butterfly go?

22/10/23, 9:41 am - Dr Raguram: The Brahmapuriswara temple is situated in the tiny hamlet of Pullamangai, on the outskirts of Pasupathikoyil in Thanjavur District. Dating back to 10th century, it is an outstanding example of early Chola temple architecture. Though comparatively smaller, it has some of the finest sculptures. Prominent among them is an exquisite depiction of Durga on the north wall of the temple. 
Durga is depicted standing on the head of the buffalo. The goddess is tall and slender and stands in a tribhanga pose; tri meaning “three” and bhanga meaning “posture”. It entails bending the body at three places, namely the knee, the hip and the shoulder. The flowing lines of the sculpture have an entrancing, sinuous quality. Rarely seen outside of Chola temples, is the umbrella (called the Venkotra Kudai) over Her head. On the right, above, is a small stylised lion and on the left a deer held by a bhuta. The presence of the deer is rather unusual. Thirugnanasambandar in Tevaram, Irandam Thirumurai, refers to Durga having a deer as ‘kalaiyathurthi’.
 
Two kneeling figures are depicted in the wall on either side of the main niche, cutting parts of their body as a sacrificial gesture. The person on the left is seen holding his hair with his left hand and is attempting to cut off his head with his right hand. The one on the right is about the cut off his leg at the knee. A similar depiction can be found in the Draupathi Ratham at Mahabalipuram. 
What struck me was the portrayal of Durga. Here the focus is not on the combat with Mahishasura but her triumphant visage after vanquishing him. There is sheer elegance in the depiction of Durga. Her face is very serene with a tranquil smile on her lips as described in the Devimahatmyam. 
ईषथ सहसं अमलं परिपूरण चन्द्र
भीबनुकरी कनकोत्तमा कान्ति कण्ठम्
“Gently smiling, spotless resembling the full moon orb, beautiful as the choicest gold and lovely was thy face.”
One of the meanings of HER name is fortress. Durga reminds us of the fortress which we each carry within ourselves. As various challenges and chaos engulf us, SHE lends a helping hand to protect and fortify our spiritual wellbeing.

23/10/23, 8:51 am - Dr Raguram: Almost all the households in south india would have a painting of Saraswati by Raja Ravi Varma. In it, Saraswati is usually depicted wearing a pure white saree sitting cross legged on the white lotus playing the Veena with peacock shown by her side. 
In Halebeedu in Hassan district, Karnataka, one can find a different, vibrant, depiction of the Goddess as Natya Saraswati. Her left foot is planted firmly on the ground and her right leg is raised, bent at the knee. If one notices carefully even the heels are crafted carefully with attention to the instep. She is holding a palm leaf in her left hand and a japamala in the right hand. Observe the way she is holding the japamala with the thumb and index finger. She is wearing various ornaments which are intricately chiselled. The canopy overhead is ornate, richly carved with Keerthimukha on top. At the bottom is her vahana, swan. She is flanked on either side by a man and woman playing instruments. The man is playing the drum and the woman is playing the cymbals. 
With every detail in its place, Saraswati dances into our hearts!
सरस्वती नृत्यतु वाचि मे सदा
sarasvati nrityatu vachi me sada
Saraswati always dances in my words
(From Saraswati Stotram composed by Sage Agasthya)

23/10/23, 11:10 pm - Nalini N R: What a beautiful sculpture Sir. It is absolutely elegant and so slender. But more than that faith matters. I think that is what enhances the beauty. And thanks for the description of the intricate work.
23/10/23, 11:22 pm - Nalini N R: Whatever I have to say will be a repetition. I think this is definitely the best tour as we can just drown in appreciating the exquisite sculptures to our heart's content.

24/10/23, 8:12 am - Dr Raguram: In sculptural depictions of Mahishasuramardini, the asura is portrayed either as a bull or a demon underneath the feet of the Goddess. There is an interesting sculpture in Chennakeshava Temple in Belur, in which the Mahishasura is actually seen emerging from the bull. Devi is pressing the bull with her right leg and one can see that the bull is buckling under the pressure. Mahishasura arises from the bull, with one leg still within it. The Goddess thrusts her weapon on Mahishasura’s chest, impaling and killing him in the process.
Today is Vijayadasami which is celebrated with much fanfare in Mysuru as the day Devi Chamundeshwari defeated and vanquished Mahishasura.  Mysuru is deemed to be a corrupted version of “Mysooru“, which is derived from the word “Mahishooru”. According to the story, Mysuru was ruled by King Mahishasura who was a buffalo-headed monster. In response to the prayer by the Gods and Goddesses to save them from the demon, Goddess Parvathi, took birth as Chamundeshwari and killed the monster on top of the Chamundi hill near Mysuru. Bettada Chamaraja Wadiyar, the Raja of Mysuru rebuilt the fort and made it his headquarters and called the city ‘Mahishura Nagara‘, meaning the city of Mahishur. Many inscriptions done in the 17th century and later refer to Mysuru as ‘Mahishuru‘.
In recent times, Dalits and rationalists in the Mysuru region opine strongly that Mahishasura was not a monster but a Buddhist king, who fought against upper caste oppression and was killed by them. They argue that the demon story was fabricated to tarnish his legacy, claiming that Mahishasura was a historical figure sent by Maurya emperor Ashoka to promote Buddhism in the region. The proponents of this theory also point out that Mysuru derives its name after Mahishooru. Such an alternate narrative is not confined to Mysuru. A tribe named Asura who are living in some parts of Jharkhand claim that they are descendants of Mahishasura and for them, it is not a day of celebration, but a day of mourning.  
These conflicting narratives are evidence of India’s incredible heterogeneity, which incorporates and accommodates differing beliefs within its fold, seamlessly.

26/10/23, 8:26 am - Dr Raguram: My first tryst with the butterflies was when I working as a tutor in the Department of Psychiatry at the Bagayam campus of Christian Medical College. I was given accommodation on a road called tantalizingly, the Mango Road and there were scores of butterflies to keep me company. It was always a pleasure to be in their midst after a busy working day. 
As years rolled by, birds replaced the butterflies. And that’s another story…
No matter where we live, butterflies are always around us. Just observing them, we experience the colors and patterns of nature. Watching them opens up a window to appreciate the beauty around us. It is a wonderful sight to see them flitting around in the morning sun. Though I have been fascinated with butterflies, I had not gotten to know and learn about them in detail. I had been following the work of Arun Urs who has been documenting the butterfly species in and around Mysore and dropped him a line to enquire whether we could join him in one of his butterfly walks. He graciously heeded our request and invited us over. We met on a clear, sunny morning on the outskirts of the Lalitha Mahal Palace. We explored the region there, studded with tall trees and mixed vegetation over the next few hours. And what a discovery it was! Arun’s knowledge about the butterflies and their habitat is truly amazing and we learnt so much about them under his tutelage. 
We have done a couple of walks with him thereafter and each one of them has been an eye opener to the butterflies and the rich biodiversity that sustains them. Arun’s dream is to transform the vast terrain into a vibrant conservation reserve and I earnestly hope that it becomes a reality. Every time I meet up with Arun, I feel inspired by his dedication and untiring involvement with butterfly conservation. He is truly the Butterfly Man of Mysore! I have been urging him to write and publish a book about his passion and work with the butterflies. It would indeed be a major contribution to increase awareness about these delicate, graceful, gossamer winged creatures and they will continue to entrance us even more!

26/10/23, 2:55 pm - Nalini N R: Each and every detail of the Goddess is like a treasure house. The tail of the bull is so beautifully woven around its leg. What a posture! And yes I have heard about the origin of the name and the other version.

27/10/23, 8:37 am - Dr Raguram: I am totally aghast at this comment. In the IT sector, people are already working long hours, bracing endless commute, losing crucial hours of sleep working at UK/US hours. If one is working 70 hours a week across 5 days, which comes out to 14 hours per day and factoring an additional 2hrs of commuting, it will be 16hours which leaves the individual with just 8 hours to pay attention to his/her personal life and health. Extremely long working hours impact the mental health of the individual, interpersonal relations and family which is all too evident to mental health practitioners. This is a recipe for burnout. Employers should consider not only extracting more from employees but also care for their mental health and family lives. 
Moreover, none of the IT companies follow the existing labor law of 48hrs per week
27/10/23, 6:38 pm - Nalini N R: Very True Sir. They don't and especially the startups which hire and fire indiscriminately. They are heading towards collapse.

28/10/23, 8:55 am - Dr Raguram: Ted Hughes (husband of Sylvia Plath) was a Poet Laureate of UK from 184 until his death on 28th October 1998. He was quite fascinated with animals and many of his poems are about nature and wildlife. Ted Hughes spent much of his time in Devon and Yorkshire countryside where hawks are often found. He wrote a wonderful poem, ‘Hawk Roositng’, which was published in his second volume of poems titled, ‘Lupercal’. Written in first person, it explores the mind of the hawk.  As a bird of prey, it kills in order to survive. The hawk is a metaphor for the perennial human need for power and control through subjugation and conquest of the powerless, which we continue to witness all around us.
HAWK ROOSTING
I sit in the top of the wood, my eyes closed.
Inaction, no falsifying dream
Between my hooked head and hooked feet:
Or in sleep rehearse perfect kills and eat.
The convenience of the high trees!
The air's buoyancy and the sun's ray
Are of advantage to me;
And the earth's face upward for my inspection.
My feet are locked upon the rough bark.
It took the whole of Creation
To produce my foot, my each feather:
Now I hold Creation in my foot
Or fly up, and revolve it all slowly -
I kill where I please because it is all mine.
There is no sophistry in my body:
My manners are tearing off heads -
The allotment of death.
For the one path of my flight is direct
Through the bones of the living.
No arguments assert my right:
The sun is behind me.
Nothing has changed since I began.
My eye has permitted no change.
I am going to keep things like this.
Dr Raguram

31/10/23, 9:51 am - Dr Raguram: John Keats was born on this day in 1795. During his short life, he published fifty-four poems using a wide range of poetic forms including odes and sonnets. Not happy with his earlier works he collected every piece of paper on which they had been written and burned them. While suffering from tuberculosis, he fell in love with Fanny Browne. Since he could not have any physical contact with her, he wrote her a series of letters. In one of them he wrote poignantly, “Illness is a long lane, but I see you at the end of it.” Later, in the same letter, he wondered, “Is there another life?
Shall I awake and find all this a dream?” He never recovered from his illness and died at the young age of 25.
Nature was one of the greatest sources of inspiration for Keats. He gazed with child-like delight at the rising sun, the moving cloud, the growing bud and the birds and turned them into beautiful poetic images. It was not the ‘intellectual beauty’ of Shelley, but one that emerged from the deepest reaches of his soul. As he wrote in the opening lines of Endymion: “A thing of beauty is a joy forever”. 
During all my birding sojourns I seek beauty in the feathered friends as in this diminutive bird, Taiga Flycatcher. It gets its name from the habitat it uses, the Taiga forest, which refers to the coniferous forests of the sub polar region. A forest dwelling winter visitor to the Indian subcontinent, it is one of the most handsome birds I have ever seen. Its beauty is not confined to its visual aspects alone, but transcends it.
As Keats wrote in  ‘On A Grecian Urn’: 
“Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know”.

In order to fly, we have to have faith in our wings. 
Just spread your wings and soar . . .

02/11/23, 9:51 am - Dr Raguram: It was autumn and the trees in Taconic State Park were in full bloom. Prominent among them was the Silk Floss Tree. It was studded with spectacular five petaled flowers. It was a stunning experience to see them. In Brazil they call the floss-silk  palo borracho “drunken tree”  because each blossom opens like a provocative dancer and it was a wonderful sight to see them waltzing in the wind.
When I got back, I came across this wonderful poem by Natalia Andreeva:
A blustery autumn breeze
is playing with cotton wool clouds,
tossing cream puff pillows
across a cornflower sky;
gusts tease the pastel blooms
and make pink petals sigh
as they try hard to hold on
before they're rudely torn away.
Like the soft pink petals,
I will also let go someday,
it's then, unfettered, I too shall fly;
I'll float along tepid streams
of spiralling warm air
and dance as I'm lifted high,
twisting and tumbling in the squalls,
silent, unbound, without care.

03/11/23, 9:40 am - Dr Raguram: It was late evening when we visited the cradle of Carnatic music, Thiruvaiyaru, a few months ago. We made our way to the samadhi of Tygaraja on the banks of the river Cauvery. It is a simple, single story building, shorn of any embellishment. Silence enveloped us as we stepped in as there was hardly anyone inside. The walls were inscribed with first two lines of krithis of the master composer. Tyagaraja’s idol is installed at a place where he attained samadhi. The idol was decorated with a garland of rudraksha and he was seen holding a sheaf of palm leaves in his left hand. The idol was personally designed and installed by a singer Nagarathnamma, often referred to as Bangalore Nagarathnamma, whose birthday is today. 
Bangalore Nagarathnamma was an exceptional person. She was born in Nanjangud to a devadasi Puttu Lakshmi. Though she was initiated into the devadasi tradition at the age of five, she was a keen learner and became adept in many languages including Sanskrit. She developed an abiding interest in music and emerged as one of the finest carnatic singers of her time. Impressed by her talents, Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar appointed her the Asthana Vidushi. She was probably the first woman to occupy such an exalted position in the royal court! She moved to Madras to consolidate her position as established herself as a popular concert artist. Her rendering of Tygaraja’s krithis enthralled huge audiences. She was the first female artist to pay income tax in Madras!
Tyagaraja occupied her mind in her waking hours as much as in her dreams. In one such dream, she saw an elderly person asking her to build a structure with her vast wealth. The dream came again after a few days and she described it to her mentor, Bidaram Krishnappa as to what it meant. He told her that the person she saw in her dream was none other than Tyagaraja himself and that she should build a memorial to him at Thiruvaiyaru. Tyagaraja’s  samadhi at that time was desolate and forlorn. The place was filled with wild growth of plants and bushes with snakes crawling and wild animals roaming. Seeing it’s sad condition, she built a mandapam over the samadhi. 
Tygaraja’s samadhi was also the place where annual music festival, Tyagaraja Aradhana,  used to be held every year. Women artists were prohibited to perform in it. Nagarathnamma invited female artists and arranged for them to perform behind the mandapam. It was huge hit. Subsequently women artists started featuring in the annual Aradhana. She bequeathed her vast fortune and property to the Aradhana trust with a clear rider that” This property shall be allowed for the purpose of conducting the Tyagaraja Aradhana only as long as women artistes are allowed to perform in it.” When she died in 1952, she was laid to rest next to Tyagaraja. To this day, she remains the only woman to be buried there.
A true feminist, Nagarathnamma shattered glass ceilings wherever she went and contributed much to the inclusion of women and especially devadasis into carnatic music at a time when society was very much Victorian in its morals. She was much ahead of her time and established the first Association for Devadasis in Madras Presidency. As its president, she took several steps towards offering financial and social support to her fellow devadasis. 
DV Gundappa wrote a moving tribute to this remarkable woman. When he met her towards the end of her life, she commented “I was Nagarathna (precious jewel on the snake’s head) by birth, then became bhogarathna (jewel of pleasure) and now I am rogarathna (jewel of disease)” DVG added that she should also be called ragarathna (jewel of musical ragas) and tyagarathna (jewel of sacrifice).

They create a reflective space for the client and facilitate deeper level of understanding of issues that confront them. For instance, when clients are battling with anger issues (which is not so uncommon these days), I use this metaphor of Thich Hanh Nhat.

13/11/23, 7:09 am - Dr Raguram: Last week Ahalya and myself were in Bandipur and it was the place where I discovered the pleasures of birding decades ago, thanks to a student during a trip. It has taken hold of me since then. Noticing it, Ahalya presented ‘The Book of Indian Birds’ by Salim Ali (whose birthday was on 12th November). It is a prized possession and has always been beside me since then. Ahalya didn’t forget to inscribe prominently in the first page of the book, “Stay close to the feathered ones!” and I have been diligently following that diktat.
Birds wake us up in the morning with their dulcet serenades. Even in the midst of urban chaos we have to just look up and see them flying their sorties with sheer abandon. Just observing them, we experience colors and patterns of nature. It offers endless opportunities for discovery, all for free. Some kind of connection emerges in those encounters with nature and our inner selves. 
For me watching birds is not about lists, BIG days but soaking in the experience and savoring moments of absolute calmness within.

Here was a person whom I had never met, but one who left a lasting impression on me through his commitment towards social justice and human rights. He is the only person who has been hailed as a “Bhishma Pitamah” of the Indian judiciary. Today is the birthday of Krishna Iyer who made the judicial system more humane. 
On this day, it is imperative to reflect on two of his perceptive observations on the role of judiciary:
“the Gandhian diagnosis of offenders as patients and his conception of prisons as hospitals mental and moral – is the key to the pathology of delinquency and therapeutic role of punishment. The whole man is a healthy man, and every man is born good. Criminality is curable deviance. If every saint has a past, every sinner has a future, and it is the role of law to remind both of this.” 
“Litigants are legal patients suffering from injustices seeking healing for their wounds. Would you tell a sufferer in the hospital that because he disclosed a certain symptom very late, therefore, he would be discharged without treatment for the sin of delayed disclosure? Humanism, which, at bottom sustains justice, cannot refuse relief unless, by entertaining the plea, another may sustain injury.”
It was Krishna Iyer’s abiding belief that the Supreme Court of India should perform as a Supreme Court for the people of India

17/11/23, 9:46 am - Dr Raguram: Li Bai was one of the most prominent poets in Chinese literature, who had an abiding interest Daoism. He wrote more than thousand poems, replete with striking imagery, infused with Daoistic metaphors. The notion of ‘Dao’, way or path, emphasizes that ideal world is to be found not by following an external route, but by a spiritual path, through state of mind, an attitude.  In Daoism, a good life is a life that’s simple, spontaneous, in harmony with nature, unencumbered by societal regulation and free from the desire to achieve social ascendancy; a life lived in accordance with nature.  Daoism doesn’t completely disregard the existence of the self, instead it acknowledges that the self exists, but it emphasizes that the person has to be “selfless”.  Instead of the “I” it’s “Others” and the person should strive to live in harmony, in a balanced life with others and nature. It is wonderfully enunciated in this quote "The perfect man has no self; the spiritual man has no achievement; the true sage has no name".

20/11/23, 8:52 am - Dr Raguram: One of the most famous opening sentences in literature is from Leo Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina: "All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." Tolstoy's own marriage seems to have fallen into the second category. Though he and his wife, Sophia, had 13 children together, they were an unhappy couple in the later part of their lives. Tolstoy contemplated leaving his wife on many occasions and finally on the night of Nov. 10, 1910, he secretly fled, leaving a note to his wife, “I am doing what old men of my age usually do: leaving worldly life to spend the last days of my life in solitude and quiet.” Taking only a few things, he boarded a train with his personal physician Makovitsky. Taking a circuitous route, involving several train changes, they planned to travel further to Bulgaria. But on the way, Tolstoy caught a cold, which led to pneumonia and he was taken of the train at Astapovo. He declined any medical intervention as he wanted to "submit himself to God’s will." He passed away in the early morning of 20th November 1910.
Tolstoy’s final moments are a poignant reminder of what he wrote in The Death of Ivan Illyich; “What death? There was no fear, because there was no death. Instead of death there was light. So that’s it! He suddenly said aloud. “Such joy!”

02/12/23, 7:43 am - Dr Raguram: From a distance, the little grebe looks like an unremarkable small duck. When you observe it closely, the first thing that strikes one is its stunningly bright chestnut coloured throat. Its eyes are beady yellow with a tiny black pupil. It is fascinating to see it diving under the water, with ease, surfacing some distance away.
Its scientific name is Tachybaptus ruficollis. The genus Tachybaptus is from the Ancient Greek takhus which means fast, just like tachycardia is a fast heartbeat, and bapto which means ‘to sink under’, similar to the word baptism. The specific name ruficollis is from the Latin rufus which means red and the Modern Latin collis, which means necked, which is originally from the Latin collum, or neck.
It has been named Switzerland’s Bird of The Year 2024.
Shakespeare in his Venus and Adonis gave a lovely description of this bird:
“Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave
Who, being look’d on, ducks as quickly in.”

03/12/23, 10:51 am - Dr Raguram: When I was in the medical school, my grand uncle Dr RV Rajam asked me to read the book, ’The Lives of a Cell: Notes of a Biology Watcher’ by Lewis Thomas. It was a collection of essays on varied topics ranging from medicine to music, written in a lively, light hearted, poetic way. It was said that he could write "as naturally as birds build a nest." In his own words, he let them “loose . . . to fly around in the dark, bumping into each other, mating in crazy ways”. The book was full of fascinating nuggets of information. “ants are very much like humans. They farm fungi, raise aphids, as a livestock, launch armies into wars, use chemical sprays to alarm, and confused enemies, capture slaves”. He was prescient in his observation about the advent of the Internet in future. “We are becoming a grid, a circuitry around the earth. If we keep at it, we will become a computer to end all computers, capable of fusing all the thoughts of the world into a syncytium.” The book opened my eyes to many things, our existence, our environment, social beings, our origin and a variety of interesting topics. ‘The Lives of a Cell’ is eleventh on the Modern Library’s list of the best 100 nonfiction books of the century. I started collecting his subsequent books and each one of them is a gem. 
Lewis Thomas was a strong advocate of a scientific approach to understand and decode the mystery of biology and medicine. However, voicing a cautious note, he observed, “Science will...produce the data..., but never the full meaning. For perceiving real significance, we shall need...most of all the brains of poets, also those of artists, musicians, philosophers, historians, writers in general”.

04/12/23, 7:14 am - Dr Raguram: Viktor Frankl’s ‘Man in search of meaning’, has had a profound impact on me. I came across the work of the poet Rainer Maria Rilke (whose birthday is today), for the first time when Frankl quoted from a poem by him, “How much suffering there is to get through!” I started reading Rilke’s poetry and was struck by its lyricism and imagery like in these lines:
“She who reconciles the ill-matched threads
of her life, and weaves them gratefully
into a single cloth… ”
We hold disparate threads in our life, some of them infused with pain and sorrow. Our task in life is how we reconcile the threads we’ve been given and turn them into a personally meaningful cloth.  A good life doesn’t come from having “good threads”.  It comes from being an adept weaver, in knowing how to reconcile oneself the ill-matched parts of our life to each other. 
And Rainer Maria Rilke observed:
“Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer.”

05/12/23, 9:26 am - Dr Raguram: Milton Erickson (whose birthday today) is an intriguing figure in the history of psychiatry. More so since most of his work was in the field of hypnosis, which was summarily dismissed by Freud. Erickson eschewed theories because he felt that they limit the way in which practitioners view the patient and the problem, “We always translate the other person’s language into our own language”.
Many of Erickson's interventions ran counter to the theoretical postulates of major schools of therapy. He emphasized the need to incorporate the resources and abilities available to the patient, to assist them in problem resolution through a variety of innovative methods, including the use of metaphors and humour. In the 1940s, it was virtually unheard of for a psychiatrist to do family therapy as he often did and his strategic family interventions are still influential today. He was also not favour of extended therapy sessions and laid the foundation for the brief therapy movement. 
He firmly believed that life is lived in the present and directed towards the future. He felt that one cannot change an unchangeable past, “In order to ride a bicycle, you do not need to know physics. So too, individuals can achieve behavioural change without developing insight into the unconscious forces that may have determined the behaviour”. 
His observation that, “Each person is a unique individual. Hence, psychotherapy should be formulated to meet the uniqueness of the individual's needs, rather than tailoring the person to fit the Procrustean bed of a hypothetical theory of human behaviour”, is a useful reminder in these times when we are immersed in a surfeit of schools of therapies, each one claiming greater effectiveness than the other. 
Dr Raguram
06/12/23, 1:01 pm - Nalini N R: An extremely useful information Sir. It is important to look back at the greats, their practical approach and I have realised over time that patients can't suit our theoretical knowledge. It must have been a very difficult terrain for him to have an unconventional approach.

07/12/23, 8:25 am - Dr Raguram: Yesterday was the death anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar who fervently espoused the cause of the oppressed, exploited, deprives sections of the society. He was not merely a dalit icon, but someone who tirelessly worked towards emancipation of women. During the All India Depressed Classes Women’s Conference held in Nagpur in 1942, he remarked, “I measure the progress of a community by the degree of progress which women have achieved.” He strongly advocated the role of education in mitigating the discrimination faced by them. In this, he was carrying forward the legacy of Jyotiba and Savitribai Phule, who started the first school for girls at the historic Bhide Wada in Pune around 1932. It opened the gates for the emergence of a subculture wherein the oppressed women started giving expression about their struggles and lived experiences through the written word. They haven’t looked back since then. There is a growing body of writings from the dalits and the marginalized, brimming with vibrancy, especially in the past decade.
I particularly like the poems of Jacinta Kerketta, who belongs to the Adivasi community of West Singhbhum district. She essentially writes in Hindi and some of her poems have been translated into English recently. In her poems, Jacinta highlights the injustices committed on the Adivasi communities and particularly the struggles of women. Her poems, like this one, abounds with wonderful, poignant, imagery:
(क्यों महुए तोड़े नहीं जाते पेड़ से? Kyon Mahue Tode Nahi Jate Ped Se?)
(Why the Mahua is not Plucked from the Tree?)
Mother, why do you wait all night
for the mahua to drop?
Why don’t you not
just pluck all the mahua from the tree?
Mother says –
They live in the womb all night long.
When the time for their birth comes
They fall by themselves to the earth.
At dawn, when they’re soaked in the dew
We pick them up and bring them home.
When the tree is going through
Labour pains all night long
Tell me, how I can
shake the branch hard?
Say, how I can forcibly 
pluck the mahua from a tree?
We just wait
Because we love them. 
Dr Raguram
07/12/23, 8:30 pm - Nalini N R: I think poets have an inner eye which can perceive the depth and a command over language to draw parallels in a subtle way!!

08/12/23, 11:32 am - Dr Raguram: I was keen to reach the temple at Bodhgaya early, before the crowds start streaming in. When I entered the temple precincts there was hardly anyone except a group of Buddhist monks who were chanting melodiously. The ebb and flow of their chanting with sporadic chirping of birds set the tone for a reflective state of mind. I made my way to the Bodhi tree and sat down. Here was the place where Shakyamuni came after practising a lifestyle of severe asceticism for six years. After enduring many hardships, he realized that that a deeper understanding of life was still eluding him. He sat and meditated under this tree and became the Buddha, “an awakened one.” Bodhi Day which is observed on 8th December marks this moment that took place 2500 years ago. In addition to its spiritual significance, the Bodhi Day reminds us of the importance of peace, compassion, and mindfulness in our everyday lives. 
Within each of us is a tiny light, entangled in the fibres of our lives. As Ramana Maharishi observed, “Your own Self-Realization is the greatest service you can render the world.”
(If you look carefully at the photograph, you can have a glimpse of a covered slab at the foot of the Bodhi tree. It marks the exact position where Buddha sat in meditation. Traditionally, it is referred to as Buddha’s Vajrasana and is the oldest piece of architecture in Bodh Gaya) 
Dr Raguram
09/12/23, 10:40 pm - Nalini N R: Yes sir, to understand and manage the outside very much depends on our work within. We are so used to deal from the other way and complicate things for ourselves. A very auspicious day to remember and practice the teachings of Buddha.

10/12/23, 7:39 am - Dr Raguram: “If we love Flowers, are we not ‘born again’ every Day,” reflected Emily Dickinson whose birthday is today. She was better known in her hometown of Amherst, Massachusetts, as a gardener rather than a poet. She was often observed by neighbours on evenings, tending her flower beds. She identified herself strongly with flowers like the tiger lily, daisy, and rose and was particularly partial to wildflowers. Her first formal act of composition as a girl was not a poem but an herbarium. 
The garden was the true inspiration for Emily Dickinson and flowers figured with richest symbolic language in her poems. As she wrote, 
“I hide myself within my flower
That fading from your Vase
You, unsuspecting, feel for me
Almost a loneliness”
For her, every single flower is a microcosm of complex ecological relationships between numerous organisms and their environment. She captured this understanding in an exquisite poem, in which the flower emerges not as the pretty object of admiration but as an enchanting, silent symphony of interconnected resilience. 
BLOOM
“Bloom — is Result — to meet a Flower
And casually glance
Would cause one scarcely to suspect
The minor Circumstance
Assisting in the Bright Affair
So intricately done
Then offered as a Butterfly
To the Meridian —
To pack the Bud — oppose the Worm —
Obtain its right of Dew —
Adjust the Heat — elude the Wind —
Escape the prowling Bee
Great Nature not to disappoint
Awaiting Her that Day —
To be a Flower, is profound
Responsibility”
Dr Raguram
10/12/23, 7:30 pm - Nalini N R: So beautiful both the photograph of flower and the poem. What a way of expressing the observation in detail and honour extended to a flower... So different from the casual look and one or two words of appreciation which we in general offer...

11/12/23, 7:47 am - Dr Raguram: Mountains might not seem like they do much, but in reality, they are one of the most important creations of nature. To raise awareness about mountains, the United Nations signifies December 11 as International Mountain Day. They contain almost half of the total biodiversity hotspots on the planet. Mountains host a significant amount of flora and fauna, which are vulnerable and at risk of extinction. Unfortunately, they are being overexploited by humans and are torn apart to make way for buildings and cities. 
Mountains are nature’s most beautiful gift to us and let us strive to take care of them. 
William Wordsworth expressed the beauty and allure of mountains poetically in ‘Lines composed a few miles above Tintern Abbey
“Therefore am I still 
A lover of the meadows and the woods
And mountains; and of all that we behold
From this green earth; of all the mighty world
Of eye and ear, both what they half create
And what perceive; well pleased to recognize
In nature and the language of the sense
The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse
The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul
Of all my moral being.” 
Dr Raguram
12/12/23, 4:01 pm - Nalini N R: Picture perfect👍 I ancient times the scriptures say mountains had huge wings but as it created lot of problems the wings were chopped off by Indra. The photograph looks like it has wings. But coming to current reality hope man doesn't go to the extent of completely destroying the nature.

16/12/23, 10:18 am - Dr Raguram: George Santayana (whose birthday is today), was a renowned philosopher, essayist, novelist and poet, known for his profound insights into human nature. He has become very well-known for his aphorisms. His most famous one "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it" is inscribed on a plaque at the entrance of the Auschwitz concentration camp.  I keep wondering whether we have drawn any lesson from it. In a lighter vein, Mark Twain famously commented, “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.” 
Santayana wrote number of iconic poems like this one, titled ‘Decima’. A decima is a ten-line stanza of poetry. It is also referred to as decima espinela after the Spanish poet Vicente Espinel  who used it extensively in his compositions.
DECIMA
Silent daisies out of reach,
Maidens of the starry grass,
Gazing on me as I pass
With a look too wise for speech,
Teach me resignation,—teach
Patience to the barren clod,
As, above your happier sod,
Bending to the wind's caress,
You—unplucked, alas!—no less
Sweetly manifest the god.

18/12/23, 9:18 am - Dr Raguram: Today is the birth centenary of TS Satyan often considered as the ‘father of photojournalism’ in India. His work was all about people, across various streams of life. One particular image that has made a deep impact in me was a photograph of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, showing Nehru walking in the corridor of the Parliament House with his back towards the camera. This was a period of time when Nehru was severely criticized for his policies regarding China which waged a war with an unprepared Indian army. The isolation and loneliness experienced by him has been artfully expressed in a simple frame.
Satyan had an unparalleled eye to capture the extraordinary in the ordinary. In his own words, “My people are not the rich and the famous. They are the simple, ordinary folk. They do not hit the headlines, yet my people are people who matter.  They were there when I picked up the camera six decades ago, and they have been there every time I have gone back to capture the interesting moments in their lives. In giving me privileged access at every step of my career as a photo journalist – even in their moments of despair or drudgery – they have never let me forget that photography is at once both an exquisite art-form and a means of communication. And that to lose sight of one aspect is to lose sight of both. Call it intimate intrusions, but it is these simple, ordinary people who dominate my oeuvre. Through a tiny aperture they allowed me to freeze-frame the cycle of life: birth, growth and death. In between, they showed me babies being born, babies being bathed, babies being suckled. They have let me in when children were learning, children were playing. They have allowed me to peep at adults at work, at worship, at recreation and adults at their everyday chores. And they have let me do so on the road, at the well, beside rivers, in crowds and in solitude. In the process, by making their private life public, they have enabled me to discover the extraordinary in the everyday." 
I had a close association with him in the later part of his life and deeply cherish the interactions. I visited him a few years before his death. It was after a major retrospective of his work. He looked at the prints which were neatly stacked, turned to me and said, “I would like you to take these”. I was deeply moved, touched and requested him to just select a few for me to treasure. Every time I look at them, the magic of a creative genius keeps unfolding.…

19/12/23, 8:36 am - Dr Raguram: Paul Klee (whose birthday was yesterday), left an indelible mark on the world of visual arts with his unique style and innovative approach to painting. A great artist, he was also an inspiring teacher, fine musician, and persuasive writer. Klee was ambidextrous. He wrote with his right hand and painted with his left. Klee’s paintings often blur the line between reality and imagination. His famous dictum was that drawing is a matter of taking a line for a walk.
Reflecting on the artistic process, he wrote, “From the root, the sap rises up into the artist, flows through him, flows to his eye. Overwhelmed and activated by the force of the current, he conveys his vision into his work. And yet, standing at his appointed place as the trunk of the tree, he does nothing other than gather and pass on what rises from the depths. He neither serves nor commands he transmits. His position is humble. And the beauty at the crown is not his own; it has merely passed through him”.
Paul Klee felt that the study of nature was one of the central principles of artistic creation. Birds and fish assume a special place in his work. They exerted a particular fascination on him because unlike humans, who are bound to the earth by gravity, they can move completely freely in air or water. This gives them their own territories which are difficult for humans to access.
Antonin Artaud famously observed, “ ln Paul Klee, the objects of the world fall into order and it seems as if he was only writing down their dictation”.

20/12/23, 8:08 am - Dr Raguram: Beau Taplin is a poet from Australia who has captured the essence of human emotions and experiences through eloquent words and enchanting themes. In his words, “I like to draw inspiration from wherever I can, so no river runs dry. The connections I have shared with people have always been a significant part of who I am, so a great deal of it comes directly from personal experiences… As far back as I can remember, I have searched for the hidden magic in things, those moments that seem to glimmer and shine with their own inner light, and so my great hope and intention with my verses and volumes is to simply encourage you to do the same. To see how the rabbit hole, this deep magic, belongs not only to stories, but can be found right here beneath the soles of your feet; in the soft light of morning, amongst the woods and the streams, in dance, in music, or a lover’s kiss”.
Beau Taplin is among the new generation of poets like Rupi Kaur, who reach out to larger audiences through social media. His brief verses/notes in Instagram continue to enthral his devoted followers. He writes, “Everyone you meet has a part to play in your story. And while some may take a chapter, others a paragraph, and most will be no more than scribbled notes in the margins. Someday, you'll meet someone who will become so integral to your life, you'll put their name in the title.”

21/12/23, 8:59 am - Dr Raguram: Kodo Sawaki is regarded by many as the greatest twentieth-century Zen master. He had a difficult start in life as his early life was full of travails of various kinds. He weathered them all and after receiving his ordination, spent many years living in an abandoned hermitage devoting himself to the practice of Zazen. He became famous throughout Japan for the sesshin (intensive meditation retreat) that he gave to people from all walks of life, without making any personal distinction or discrimination. Kodo Sawaki called his monastery a “moving monastery”. He gave Zen a new life and “brought fresh air to the decaying Zen” by staying away the frozen rituals. His tendency to travel alone and his refusal to settle down at any monastery in the classical sense earned him the nickname, “Homeless Kodo”.
Kodo Sawaki taught that the practice of zen is not about achieving enlightenment, but rather about living in the present moment and being mindful of our actions and thoughts. He emphasized the importance of zazen, or seated meditation to cultivate a sense of inner peace and clarity. Kodo encouraged people to live a life of simplicity and to find joy in the small moments of everyday life.
When he was 86, Kodo felt gravely ill and spent the last three months of his life at Antai-ji, a temple transformed by him into a place for a pure practice. From his bed, he spent a long time looking at the Takagamine mountain and, three days before his death, he told a nun: “Look at that. Nature is magnificent. In all my life, I have never encountered a person to whom I could have submitted and who I could have admired. But this Takagamine mountain looks upon me form the heights saying: ‘Kodo, Kodo’”. 
These were his last words. He passed away on the 21st of December, 1966

22/12/23, 7:27 am - Dr Raguram: Srinivasa Ramanjuan (whose birthday is today) is an enigma and continues to be one. To borrow a phrase from a radio address by Winston Churchill in 1939, to understand his creative process, “It’s a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma…” “The enigma of Ramanujan’s creative process is still covered by a curtain that has barely been drawn,” observed the mathematician Bruce Berndt.
Like many geniuses, Srinivasa Ramanujan was a dreamer. Many of this profound insights were ‘revelations’ unravelled in dreams. Recording one such dream, he wrote, “While asleep, I had an unusual experience. There was a red screen formed by flowing blood, as it were. I was observing it. Suddenly a hand began to write on the screen. I became all attention. That hand wrote a number of elliptic integrals. They stuck to my mind. As soon as I woke up, I committed them to writing.” Throughout his career, “scrolls of the most complicated mathematics” would unfold before him in dreams. In a dream early in his life, the goddess Namagiri bestowed him with the gift of precociousness by writing on his tongue. Later, during a difficult period in his life, his abdomen appeared to him as an appendage of “indefinable mathematical surges”
Revelatory dreams have been mentioned for many thousands of years, across cultures in the East and Near East. In Greek mythology, Oneiroi were the spirits, daimones, or gods of dreams in Greek mythology.  Each night the Oneiroi would depart from Erebus, like a flock of bats leaving their caves. As the Oneiroi departed from Erebus they would pass between one of two gates. One gate was made of horn, and the Oneiroi who passed through this gate would bring to mortals truthful, prophetic god sent dreams. The second gate was made of ivory, and the Oneiroi who passed through this gate brought only false dreams, or those dreams without meaning. Virgil wrote in the epic poem Aeneid:
Two gates the silent house of Sleep adorn;
Of polish'd ivory this, that of transparent horn:
True visions thro' transparent horn arise;
Thro' polish'd ivory pass deluding lies.
Ramanjuan seems to have passed through the gates of horn to provide us with immense, intriguing mathematical insights.
In the garden of dreams
He wandered deeper
And an enchanted forest unfurled…

03/01/24, 9:19 am - Dr Raguram: Rudaki was a poet, singer, and musician who is regarded as the first major poet to write in New Persian. He wrote several thousand poems and unfortunately only a few survive. In Iran, Rudaki is acknowledged as the "founder of New Persian poetry" and in Tajikistan as the "father of Tajik literature". Rudaki was also an innovator of poetic form. Aside from writing in forms inherited from Arabic poetry, he is thought to be the first poet to have written in the rubaiyat form, which is a quatrain consisting of two couplets. 
Interestingly he translated Panchatantra stories which gained popularity in the medieval Europe as, 'The Fables of Bidpai'. The Persian version by Rudaki is known as ‘Kalileh o Demneh’. 
His poetry is replete with interesting imagery and vivid description of nature. Observing the clouds one day, he wrote:
Look at that cloud,
how it cries like a grieving man, 
Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.
Now and then the sun peeks from behind the clouds
Like a prisoner hiding from the guard.
This particular poem is about the Hoopoe. Hoopoe has had an important status in Persian literature and often considered as a guide that directs the mystics toward God. Rudaki wrote:
I saw a hoopoe near Sarakhs 
Whose little song reached the clouds.
She was wearing a little cloak Of many different colors.
I stand before you in awe.

04/01/24, 8:53 am - Dr Raguram: All of us are accustomed to seeing with our eyes and also communicate with the written word. When blindness sets in and one cannot see, one has to rely on the sense of touch. It is such a poignant and inspiring sight in our cities to see the blind negotiate the travails of travel with the touch of the white wand. Can the sense of exquisite touch help them also to read and communicate?
This was the quest of Louis Braille (whose birthday is today), who lost his vision early in life. When he was 12, a French soldier by the name of Charles Barbier introduced him to “night writing,” a system he had invented that used patterns of 12 raised dots to simulate letters so soldiers could communicate across battles in secret. Braille’s magic wand was a group of six dots in which the vertical line consists of three dots, and the horizontal of two. The combination of these dots produces characters to each of which a particular meaning is assigned, just as the seeing does to the alphabets in print. It is amazing how six dots can be so combined to represent so many things. Braille refined this by the time he was 15 and published his Braille Code in 1829. Unfortunately, it did not receive international attention until 1868, a full 16 years after Braille’s death.
The Braille Code liberated the “People of the Night”, who had resigned to the dark abyss of blindness. It opened doors of learning and was instrumental in weaving bonds of companionship between those who could not see. 
What is remarkable about Braille is that he was only a child when he developed his revolutionary invention. He had no training, no funding, no public or institutional support, no commercial motive or business plan and only the dream to open the doors of knowledge to the blind.
As John Lee Clark, a blind poet wrote about Braille:
The world rests on my lap.
If my finger is the sky,
Then under it the fields prosper.
Row after perfect row of buds
Bid me gather all I can.
The harvest is food for thought

05/01/24, 10:09 am - Dr Raguram: It was a bright morning and as we were making our way in the Coyote Hills Regional Park, we heard a loud, rattling sound. And when we looked around, a bird with bright colours under its wings caught our eyes. It perched on the outer branches of a tree, feasting on the berries. It was the Northern Flicker. As we were watching, it, hopped down onto the ground, foraging for insects. Its scientific name is Colaptes auratus. Colaptes means “to peck.” Northern Flickers are often referred to as the “anteaters of the sky.” Unlike other woodpeckers, which usually remain high in the treetops, Northern Flickers venture down to ground level to search for their favourite meal, ants. They are ably assisted in this task by their slightly curved bill. Their dusky brow plumage helps them to blend with the colours of the forest floor. Most woodpeckers in North America have black white stripped plumage, which helps them to blend in with tree bark.  Northern Flickers stand apart and are considered the ‘black sheep’ of the woodpecker family because they have brown feathers and forage for food on the ground. The Northern Flicker is one of the few North American woodpeckers that is strongly migratory.

06/01/24, 9:46 am - Dr Raguram: Among the many calls that I received this New Year, I was deeply touched by a particular one. It was from a lady whom I had known for the past few years. She rang up and said, “Doctor let this New Year be good for you and all those who help others”. What is distinctive about the caller is that she is a crematorium worker who handles all the paper work there.
I met her a few years ago, helping a friend who had lost a family member, to fill the forms. When I was about to leave, she asked me whether I was a doctor. Hearing the affirmative answer, she shared her psychological travails which were being attended to by a dear former student. I reassured her stating that she was in good hands while emphasizing the need to be regular with treatment. She profusely thanked me and thereafter kept in touch with me periodically. 
Working in a crematorium can be a daunting task, more so being a woman. At a time when the term ‘stress’ is flaunted widely, I was keen to know more about her and how she coped with her situation. Her answer was simple, “I earn a livelihood doctor, for the sake of my children, for their better future”. I gathered that her husband was a drunkard without any regular work and she had to tend for two young children, with very little support from the extended family. She works six days a week with few breaks or any holiday. At the end of a busy working day, she gets back home, has a bath and starts cooking for the night. Her husband scolds and often beats her, if by chance the food is delayed. He is also sexually demanding and if she refuses, starts suspecting her. In spite of these ordeals when I chance to see her at work, I invariably find her attending to her task with a smile on her face. 
By accepting the job, she has joined a cadre of Indian women who are entering arenas from which they have traditionally been excluded. That she has chosen to work in a space with significant stigma associated with it, where even men feel uneasy to be in, is a testament to her resilience. 
A plant that can teach us resilience is the bamboo. It can withstand twice as much force bearing down on it while being stretched, pulled or bent. According to a Japanese proverb: “In time, even the strongest wind tires itself out, but the bamboo remains standing tall and still.” 
There is an interesting Zen parable, ‘Be like a bamboo’:
A Zen Master was walking through the forest down a narrow trail with one of his students along a steep incline. The student lost his footing and slipped; just as he began tumbling down the hill, the student reached out and grabbed a small bamboo tree. The bamboo bent nearly all the way over as the student continued to hold on tightly. He pulled himself up and brushed off the dirt with the Zen Masters help.
“Did you notice that when you fell, you grabbed a hold of the bamboo and it bent nearly all the way over and still supported you.” the Zen Master asked.
“Yes,” the student replied. The Zen Master gripped the bamboo and pulled the bamboo over.
“Be like the bamboo,” the Zen Master said as he let go of the bamboo and it sprang back to its up-right position. “It is pushed around by the wind and yet it always bounces back and grows upward, toward the sun, enlightenment. Have you ever felt as though you were going to snap? Have you ever felt as though you were at your breaking point, emotionally?”
“Yes,” the student replied.
“Then bend, do not break, such is the way with bamboo. It endures the stress and finds a way to bounce back!” the Zen Master stated. “This is called resilience.”
Throughout our journey in life, we meet people along the way and we connect with the heart of a few from whom we draw inspiration. They become a poem or a story in my life to live by.

09/01/24, 8:55 am - Dr Raguram: I have a time worn book of ‘Second Sex’ by Simone de Beauvoir (whose birthday is today) and it is incredible as to how it is so relevant today, decades after its publication. Weaving together perspectives from biology, psychoanalysis, anthropology, sociology, psychology, history she narrates as to how gender demarcation came into being and women lead a life as the ‘Second Sex’; “Humanity is male, and man defines woman, not in herself, but in relation to himself.” She theorizes about every phase of a woman's life, from infancy to old age, and the events outlining each phase with insight and erudition. No woman before her had written with such candour about the most intimate aspects of women. Adopting an existentialist framework, she emphasizes on the social construction of femininity. Women are not born knowing what it means to be a woman, how to behave, what jobs to do, how to feel, but are rather socialized into the role of ‘woman,’ often by men; “One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.” 
She concludes ‘Second Sex’ with optimistic undertones, hoping that either gender will eventually see eye to eye and accept each other as subjects and equals.
“On the day when it will be possible for woman to love not in her weakness but in her strength, not to escape herself but to find herself, not to abase herself but to assert herself on that day love will become for her, as for man, a source of life and not of mortal danger.”
It is an important read in these times when there is an attempt to define the role of women according to staid ideologies. 
Dr Raguram
09/01/24, 10:29 pm - Nalini N R: Very relevant even today. Though many women are getting educated, the stereotype continues to haunt many families. Unsaid rule still dominates and the worst scenario is when the 'man' has a personality disorder!
10/01/24, 9:05 am - Dr Raguram: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 9:05 am - Dr Raguram: I had posted yesterday about Simone de Beauvoir’s ‘Second Sex’, wherein she urges women to 
have the freedom to escape from prescribed social roles and seek their own identity. This perspective has been articulated well in many works of fiction. Daisy Rockwell's translation of Geetanjali Shree's Hindi novel ‘Ret Samadhi’ ‘’रेत समाधि’ which I read some time ago, is one such engaging narrative. It traces the life trajectory of a woman who is recently bereaved and her journey to discover aspects of self that were deeply buried within her. 
The strength of any work of fiction is that it can be read at different layers, each with its own attendant meaning. Grief after a loss of a partner has been essayed in many novels. Usually it follows a predictable path, focusing on the loss and its emotional impact within the individual. What is different in this work is the broader narration of separation and loss in the historical context of partition and the quest of the protagonist to seek her personal identity embedded in it. 
The novel is tale of transformative powers of crossing the ‘borders’, of geography, gender and prescriptive roles, reaffirming that the inner landscape has no borders. “Anything worth doing transcends borders”. 
The protagonist’s travel is also a journey into her own self, opening doors of discovery. In her words, “Always, at least once, every woman, whether this one or that one, whether small or big, finds herself at the door, one foot poised in the air, like a dancer striking a mudra, a pose, in order to re-enter the home or that door which she has renounced and already left far behind, asking herself in that moment, Is this my world in which I’m setting foot, or is it that which is receding behind me, where I had gone, or whence I’ve come?”
As for the story, “Once you’ve got women and a border, a story can write itself. Even women on their own are enough. Women are stories in themselves, full of stirrings and whisperings that float on the wind, that bend with each blade of grass.”
There is extensive use of metaphors like doors and windows. “there was a painter, Bhupen Khakkar. He told stories with brush…He knew that a story cannot be locked into a box, or a canvas, or a gaze. So he never tried. On the contrary, he always left a small window, an empty space, so the story could move on at will and take another path if it so desired. Because stories never end. They jump through windows and cracks…or create them by shaking, causing the earth to quake"
The novel is replete with lyrical passages, like this one, “Ma sips her morning tea as though drinking in a bird’s song”.
All together a fascinating read!

11/01/24, 10:23 am - Dr Raguram: William James (whose birthday is today), is most famous for his psychology textbook,’ Principles of Psychology’ which was published in 1890. It consisted of two volumes with over 1400 pages and took him 12 years to write. He did not produce any original research, did not perform any experiment, yet he became the driving force behind psychology. 
Of the many topics he addressed during his life time, he is most famous for his theories about emotions and consciousness. Concerning emotions, James believed that a person is exposed to a stimulus, has a physiological reaction, and then interprets that reaction as emotion. So, first comes physiological arousal, then the subjective interpretation of those processes as emotion. An independent researcher in Denmark, Carl Lange, developed a similar theory of emotion at roughly the same time as James did. Their view of emotion came to be known as the James-Lange theory of emotion. Though it was later thought not to be an accurate theory of how emotions work, its framework was quite influential in drawing attention to the interaction between physiological processes and emotion. 
William James also conceptualized consciousness as a river or a stream, constantly changing and never the same. He had an abiding interest in religion and faith. He believed that divine existence can be justified by the emotional benefits it brings to one’s life. His book ‘The Varieties of Religious Experience: a study in human nature’, examines varied forms of religious experiences such as mystical experiences, conversion, saintliness, and spirituality from a psychological perspective. I was quite surprised to learn that the emphasis given in Alcoholic Anonymous is largely due to the influence of this book.  It seems that when Bill, a co-founder of AA, was trying to fight his way back to sobriety, chanced upon a copy of the book and was deeply impressed by James' "great wisdom." It also helped Bill to finally achieve sobriety  and the impact of the book can be seen in the formulation of AA's basic ideas.
James was an inspiring teacher. His students included such luminaries as Theodore Roosevelt, author and philosopher George Santayana and Gertrude Stein.
I particularly like this observation of his, “A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.”

13/01/24, 10:01 am - Dr Raguram: In my forays into the Zen landscape, I discovered the poetry of Ryokan. His poems are direct and unpretentious, infused with profound insights. For example, he wrote:
The rain has stopped, the clouds have drifted away,
and the weather is clear again.
If your heart is pure, then all things in your world are pure.
Abandon this fleeting world, abandon yourself,
Then the moon and flowers will guide you along the Way.
He is reported to have led a live of extreme simplicity. He showed love for all living things to the extent of placing lice under his robes to keep them warm, allowing thieves to take freely from his possessions, and letting one leg protrude from his mosquito net at night to give the mosquitos food. As a Zen priest, he never established his own temple, and lived by alms. Instead of preaching, he enjoyed companionship and conversation with many ordinary people. His practice consisted of sitting in zazen meditation, walking in the woods, playing with children, making his daily begging rounds, reading, writing poetry and on occasion drinking sake with friends. He was adept in calligraphy and was also known as one of Japan's great calligraphers.
He was deeply influenced by the teachings of Dogen, the 13th century monk, about whom I wrote sometime back. Ryokan never published a collection of verse while he was alive. One of his last verses reads;
Life is like a dewdrop,
Empty and fleeting;
My years are gone
And now, quivering and frail,
I must fade away.
As Rabindranath Tagore wrote, “Let your life lightly dance on the edges of Time like dew on the tip of a life.”

15/01/24, 8:08 am - Dr Raguram: India with its diverse and rich cultural heritage celebrates multitudes of festivals throughout the year. The harvest festival holds a distinct place among them. The onset of harvest season is observed all across the country under various names based on the region where it is celebrated. It is essentially an act of thanksgiving to the farmers. Farmers who tend to the land with care and concern are the backbone of our society. We may need the help of a doctor or a lawyer sometime in our lives, but we need the farmer every day, three times a day to provide us with food. 
Saint Poet Thiruvalluvar’s magnum opus Thirukkural consists of 133 chapters having 10 couplets each. Each one of them consisting of just one line and a half, like a short haiku. Thiruvalluvar devotes an entire chapter (104) wherein he extols the glory and greatness of agriculture and the important role of farmers. 
இரவார்  இரப்பார்க்கொன்று  ஈவர் கரவாது 
கைசெய்தூண் மாலை யவர்.
Those who plough do not ask but give with both hands
To those that ask, the bounty they have tilled
On this festival day let us pay obeisance to our indefatigable farmers who are battling tremendous odds to keep us satiated.
As the Pongal brims over the pot
Let us pray to the lord
That joy bubbles in farmer’s heart 
Forever

16/01/24, 8:17 am - Dr Raguram: Today is Mattu Pongal. On this day cattle are given a well-deserved day of rest and a pride of place. They are washed, their horns are painted and covered with shining metal caps. Multi-coloured beads, tinkling bells, sheaves of corn and flower garlands are tied around their necks. They look majestic in all their finery. It is essentially a day of thanksgiving to the cattle friends by the farmers. Cattle play important roles in different stages of cultivation. Even after the fields are harvested, they are used to separate the ear of the grains from the stalk by walking over the stalks. Besides their importance in ploughing fields, their manure also serves as natural fertilisers. While the practice of using cattle as farm labour has all but disappeared in Tamil Nadu today, there is still a thriving dung economy. For example, ‘Thozhuvam Farmer Producer Organization’ in Madurai directly sources cow dung and markets value-added products such incense sticks, dung handicrafts, and more. Their main agenda is to safeguard the traditional Pulikulam and Theni hill cattle breeds that are on the verge of extinction.
There are beautiful descriptions of cattle in Sangam poetry. For example, Orampokiyar wrote more than 100 poems and in one verse in Aiynkurunooru., he offers a beautiful description of a buffalo:
'துறை மீன் வழங்கும் பெரு நீர்ப் பொய்கை,
அரி மலர் ஆம்பல் மேய்ந்த நெறி மருப்பு
ஈர்ந் தண் எருமைச் சுவல் படு முது போத்து,
தூங்கு சேற்று அள்ளல் துஞ்சி, பொழுது பட,
பைந் நிண வராஅல் குறையப் பெயர்தந்து,
குரூஉக் கொடிப் பகன்றை சூடி, மூதூர்ப்
போர் செறி மள்ளரின் புகுதரும் ஊரன்
an old buffalo, his back wet and cool, his horns curved,
grazes on bright-flowered lilies
in a pond full of water and fish
sleeps all night in the oozing mud,
and then when dawn comes
walks out, crushing fish with their feet,
drapes himself with bright creepers,
and enters the ancient town like a warrior victorious in battle.

I had never heard of a poem dedicated to buffalos. Very nice.

18/01/24, 8:28 am - Dr Raguram: Most us would have read ‘Winnie the Pooh’ by AA Milne (whose birthday is today). He wrote seven novels, five nonfiction books and 34 plays, along with numerous stories and articles. But ‘Winnie the Pooh’ which was published in 1926, eclipsed and erased the memory of his other works. It featured characters based on his son, who was the inspiration for Pooh’s best friend, Christopher Robin and his stuffed animal toys. The Hundred Acre Woods, where Pooh’s adventures take place, was based on the 500 Acre Woods near Milne’s home. 
A few years after Winnie-the-Pooh was published, Milne began to resent the fame that it brought on him and his family. He stated, “I feel that Christopher Robin has already had more publicity than I want for him. I do not want CR Milne to ever wish that his name was Charles Robert.” His son also disliked this attention, as the legacy of Christopher Robin and Pooh Bear followed him all throughout his life, making it difficult for him to make a name as his own person. In his memoir, ‘The Enchanted Place’, he wrote, “In pessimistic moments, when I was trudging London in search of an employer wanting to make use of such talents as I could offer, it seemed to me, almost, that my father had got to where he was by climbing upon my infant shoulders, that he had filched from me my good name and had left me with nothing but the empty fame of being his son.”
Strangely, there have been several attempts to ban the book. In 2009, Russian authorities banned it for being pro-Nazi, after an image of Pooh with a swastika was discovered amongst an extremist’s collection. In the United Kingdom, the book was banned from public schools, as the character Piglet might offend Muslim and Jewish students who abstain from pork for religious reasons. And in 2017, the Chinese government began censoring Winnie the Pooh on social media platforms after critics used the character to mock Xi Jinping and his policies.
What is more galling is the attempt to identify psychiatric disorders among the characters in the book. In 2000, paediatrician Sarah Shea and her team released a journal article titled “Pathology in the Hundred Acre Wood: a neurodevelopmental perspective on A.A. Milne.” It proposed that each of the Winnie-the-Pooh characters displayed symptoms of a different mental disorder. Unfortunately this trend caught on and there have been several attempts in this vein over the years.
In spite of all this, ‘Winnie the Pooh’ resonates with people of all ages due to its relatable characters and heart-warming stories, addressing themes such as friendship, love, and the pursuit of happiness.
"Sometimes, if you stand on the bottom rail of a bridge and lean over to watch the river slipping slowly away beneath you, you will suddenly know everything there is to be known" Pooh.

19/01/24, 7:53 am - Dr Raguram: When I look at a painting by Paul Cezanne (whose birthday is today), I am attracted to his innovative use of colour, particularly its relationship with form. His visual language is uniquely personal. There is a magical quality in his canvases which are replete with use of multitude of colours and distinctive brush strokes. He explored an amazing range of subjects throughout his career: landscape, portraiture, figures and still life. I am particularly fond of his still life paintings. In the hands of an unimaginative artist, still life can be quite stilted, but not in Cezanne’s hands. He was particularly drawn into painting fruits, particularly apples which take on an inexplicable lustrous luminosity in his paintings. He confided to a friend that "they [fruits] love having their portraits done. They exhale their message with their scent. They reach you with all their smells and tell you about the fields they’ve left, the rain that made them grow, the dawns they watched. When I’m outlining the skin of a lovely peach with soft touches of paint, or a sad old apple, I catch a glimpse in the reflections they exchange of . . . the same love of the sun, the same recollection of the dew, a freshness." 
How should one look at his paintings? In his own words, “Shut your eyes, wait, and think of nothing. Now, open them … one sees nothing but a great coloured undulation. What then? An irradiation and glory of colour. This is what a picture should give us … an abyss in which the eye is lost, a secret germination, a coloured state of grace … loose consciousness. Descend with the painter into the dim tangled roots of things, and rise again from them in colours, be steeped in the light of them.”
Now look at Cezanne’s apples and see them come alive!

20/01/24, 7:01 am - Dr Raguram: You cannot miss the European Robin when you take a stroll in the gardens of London. unlike its counterpart in America, it is a colourful bird with a striking orange breast. As you watch, it makes forays to the ground to catch insects and quickly flies back to its shady perch. The French naturalist Georges Cuvie gave the bird its current name Erithacus rubecula. The epithet rubecula is derived from the Latin, ruber ‘red’.
The Victorian postmen used to be known as robins because part of their tunic was orange red. When Christmas cards first came into vogue they were brought by robins! And robins started featuring in the in the Christmas cards too.
There is a wealth of Christian mythology associated with it. The legend is that the robin was moved when it saw Christ on the cross and began to pluck the thorns out of the crown of thorns.  The blood stained the robin and hence its orange red breast. According to an Irish tale, a robin flew in to see the infant Jesus in the manger. The infant reached out to touch the bird causing it to blush in deference and hence its colour!  
Shakespeare refers to the charming song of the European Robin in Two Gentlemen of Verona. 
Valentine: Why, how know you that I am in love?
Speed: Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms like a malcontent; to relish a love song like a robin redbreast; to walk alone like one that had the pestilence; to sigh like a schoolboy that had lost his ABC; to weep like a young wench that had buried her grandam; to fast like one that takes diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to speak puling like a beggar at Hallowmas.
Emily Dickinson wrote a lovely small poem about it:
If I can stop one heart from breaking,
I shall not live in vain;
If I can ease one life the aching,
Or cool one pain,
Or help one fainting robin
Unto his nest again,
I shall not live in vain. 
It is believed that when a robin appears, it is a sign that a loved one is near.

21/01/24, 8:55 am - Dr Raguram: It is always so wonderful to see the Malabar Giant Squirrel prancing from one tree branch to another. It will pause for a while to eat fruits with its tiny hands and scramble to the upper reaches of the canopy in a flash of a second. The multi-coloured magician is adept in nimbly disappearing without a trace. They build their nests, called dreys, in close proximity to each other and use them as decoys to fool predators. The joy of observing them up close is truly memorable.
I had my first glimpse of it several decades ago in Bandipur. I had gone with a group of students and when we ventured into the forest, I heard a very unusual call. As I was scouting to locate its source with the binocular, I was delighted to find to find the Malabar Giant Squirrel in the upper reaches of a tree a few hundred feet away. Overjoyed to sight it, I passed the binoculars around so that others could see it. While they were engrossed watching it, I turned back and was shocked to find a lone tusker not too far away. I gently tapped them and whispered, “Hey, there is a tusker here”, only to be meet with a response, “Don’t joke Sir”. Their reaction soon turned into alarm when they turned around and saw the tusker. Overwhelmed with increasing fright, we all gave a loud shout and ran for our lives. Catching up with my breath after some time, when I looked back, I saw the tusker turning its back and making its way into the forest. 
Oblivious to this drama, the Giant Squirrel was foraging amongst the branches of tree with sheer abandon at a distance.

23/01/24, 9:11 am - Dr Raguram: Sometime back we visited Avani in Kolar district (a detailed description is at: (https://www.profraguram.com/musings--reflections/avani). Avani attained prominence due to myriad legends associated with it. Most importantly, it is said to be the site of Uttara Ramayana. There is a small beautiful, Ramalingeshwara temple which dates back to 10th century. A hillock strewn with boulders forms an interesting backdrop to this ancient temple. It is believed that Sita retreated to this hill after her trial by fire and gave birth to Lava and Kusha who grew up in the hermitage of Valmiki. There are several caves; one of them is considered to be Valmiki’s ashram and another one where Sita lived and cooked for her children. 
I was keen to find out whether there are other places identified as Sita’s Kitchen. To my great surprise, I discovered that there are several Sita’s Rasoi (kitchen) dotted across the subcontinent. At least two of Sita’s kitchens have been documented in Ayodhya, but only one survived the demolition of the Babri Masjid. I understand that within the complex on the Ramkot in Ayodhya, there is a building bearing the painted phrase “Janmasthana Sita Rasoi” (Birthplace Sita’s Kitchen). The garbhagriha contains a rolling board, rolling pin, chulha and an image of Sita.  
When I searched for other ‘Sita’s Rasois’, I found documentation of several others: Lalapur near Allahabad, Chitrakoot, Brahmavarta in UP and Nasik in Maharashtra amongst others. Each one of them is adjacent to Valmiki’s ashram and similarly contain a rolling pin, board and a chulha. 
I also looked for mention of Sita and her kitchen in many of the Ramayanas. There were none. An array of localized narratives and memories associated with Sita and her kitchen seemed to have evolved over time across the country. It would be a fascinating exercise to explore how these memories of the past have been constructed, celebrated and sometimes politically appropriated too. 
While Rama is valorised and huge temples are built to honour him, for some inexplicable reason, Sita has been relegated and confined to the kitchen. Is her power and authority confined to the kitchen alone? Cooking, to a large extent has been embedded in the patriarchal construction of femininity. If the kitchen is a feminine abode, it might also be a site of resistance.
In the animated film, ‘Sita Sings The Blues’, Nina Paley relocates her as a woman who retells her own story in her own voice in an altogether different context. Sita’s songs not only give her a voice.

In Valmiki Ramayana there are many situations where her strengths, importance, judgment are highlighted. Actually Laksmana was the one who took the responsibility of looking after the welfare like  constructing ashrams, getting fruits etc. May be cooking she did as part of her duty😊

25/01/24, 9:32 am - Dr Raguram: Nambinarayana temple is at Thirukurungudi, a serene village in Tirunelveli district. It is a beautiful temple with hundreds of sculptures and carvings. Of the several lovely ones in the main gopuram, an interesting one depicts a seated Rama contemplating as to how he can journey across the sea to reach Lanka. For three days he fasted and meditated, praying to the God of the sea, Varuna, to appear and to help him find a way to cross to Lanka. There was no response, nothing but the endless, repetitive sound of the waves. Rama, infuriated by this unbearable silence picked up his bow and began to shoot arrows into the sea. The creatures of the sea began to die, and the waters began to burn. The army of monkeys who had come to help Rama were aghast and alarmed at this display of violence against the sea and her innocent creatures and tried to dissuade him to stop the onslaught. Just as Rama was about to unleash the all-powerful weapon, Brahmastra, Varuna appeared out of the sea. He bowed to Rama and calmly explained that there was nothing to be so upset about and that he would ensure that the waves would remain still while a way was found for Rama’s forces to cross the sea, and that they would remain calm until they had completed their crossing. Then, Hanuman came up with a solution and assured Rama that he along with other monkeys would build a bridge. 
In this small carving you can see Rama and in front of him is Varuna. Lakshmana is standing behind him. He is surrounded by the army of monkeys. Hanuman at his feet and another one by Rama’s side are trying to dissuade him from taking any drastic action. 
The bridge as a metaphor, conveys multifaceted meanings. It symbolizes a sense of connectedness and union, both physically and psychologically. Even the process of building the structure is not merely an individual act, but a collective one driven by a common cause to link and join together that which is disparate and separate. Something to ponder and reflect on…

27/01/24, 8:44 am - Dr Raguram: The appeal of Alice in Wonderland never dims. The haunting stories of Lewis Carroll have a mesmerizing quality. His imagination, distilled in the pages of his books cast a teasing spell on the reader. They are an exhilarating medley of haunting puzzles imbued with multiple meanings. Every time I read them, I travel along with Alice, down the rabbit hole and loose myself amidst the tangible aspects of the story and the intangible, hidden nuances.  
As the author reflects, “finding meaning, like losing meaning, involves pleasure as well as pain. But then losing meaning, like finding it, does too”.
Like Alice, we continue to grapple with the question, “Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s the great puzzle.”

28/01/24, 10:12 am - Dr Raguram: One of the birds I closely observed during my forays in the vast, arid lands of Rann of Kutch was the sleek, powerful, fast flying Peregrine Falcon. I observed it making sorties with tremendous speed, caressing the wind with an agile grace. It was exploring the boundless sky with unfettered freedom.
After my return, I read WB Yeats famous poem, ‘The Second Coming’. Yeats wrote this poem after World War I, a global catastrophe that killed millions of people. The First World War unleashed humanity’s power to harm and kill, a trend that has gotten worse with the advent of the nuclear power. The poem is replete with lots of Biblical allusions. Beyond this, to me personally, the first stanza of the poem with its potent images, perceptively describes the plight of our civilization. The “falconer,” representing our attempt to control the natural world, has lost its “falcon” in the ever expanding “gyre” (of progress?). The poet alludes to an evolving situation when "Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold." 
“The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.”
Though written decades ago, these lines, imbued with timeless allegory, resonate even now,

01/02/24, 8:04 am - Dr Raguram: Every time I step into the bronze gallery of the Chennai museum, I am overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of the priceless exhibits encompassed in its glass display cases. The most impressive pieces are that of Siva as the cosmic dancer, Nataraja.  
Whenever I look at them, I recollect the words of Fritjof Capra, (whose birthday is today),in ‘The Tao of Physics’, relating the Nataraja’s dance with modern physics: 
“Every subatomic particle not only performs an energy dance, but also is an energy dance; a pulsating process of creation and destruction…without end…For the modern physicists then, Shiva’s dance is the dance of subatomic matter. As in Hindu mythology, it is a continual dance of creation and destruction involving the whole cosmos; the basis of all existence and of all natural phenomena...the metaphor of the cosmic dance thus unifies ancient mythology, religious art and modern physics.” 
He went on to comment, “The mystic and the physicist arrive at the same conclusion; one starting from the inner realm, the other from the outer world. The harmony between their views confirms the ancient Indian wisdom that Brahman, the ultimate reality without, is identical to Atman, the reality within.” 
In the words of Appar, the seventh century Shaivaite poet saint, who went to Chidambaram to see the cosmic dance of Siva, 
குனித்த புருவமும் கொவ்வைச் செவ்வாயில் குமிண்சிரிப்பும் 
பனித்த சடையும் பவளம்போல் மேனியில் பால் வெண்ணீறும் 
இனித்தம் உடைய எடுத்த பொற்பாதமும் காணப்பெற்றால் 
மனித்தப் பிறவியும் வேண்டுவதே இந்த மாநிலத்தே 
“If you could see 
the arch of his brow 
the budding smile 
on his lips red as the kovvai fruit 
cool matted hair 
the milk-white ash on coral skin 
and the golden foot raised up in dance 
our birth on this earth is fulfilled” 
In sculptures, paintings and verses, Nataraja continues to dance...beyond time.

02/02/24, 8:19 am - Dr Raguram: It was a breezy early morning and I was standing on the banks of a large swathes of wetland. The air resonated with myriad calls of birds that inhabited the vast terrain. I was totally amazed at the wide variety of birds in front of me. Suddenly, I noticed a flash of light and it was the bronze winged jacana. The early morning sun was caressing its beautiful plumage with lustrous hues. It was foraging on the aquatic vegetation, daintily balancing itself on the water with its long feet and toes, with the elegance of a ballerina.These wetlands provide crucial breeding, nesting and feeding habitats for countless numbers of birds. 
Wetlands and human beings are all part of a delicate and interconnected ecosystem.They play a vital role in treating and detoxifying a variety of waste products and are often described as earth’s kidneys. In addition, through sequestering and releasing a major portion of fixed carbon they are important regulators of global climate change.
February 2nd of each year is observed globally as World Wetlands Day to raise awareness about the value of wetlands for nature and society. The theme this year is ‘wetlands and human wellbeing.’ It emphasizes how all aspects of human well-being are linked to the health of the world’s wetlands and calls on each of us to value their importance. 
While it is heartening to notice that three new wetlands are added to the Ramsar sites in Karnatka, it is equally saddening to witness increasing habitat fragmentation, polluting  runoff and invasive species that plague the wetlands especially in rapidly urbanizing areas, like Bangalore.
As Sandra Postel, a renowned expert on freshwater ecosystems cautioned, “For many of us, water simply flows from a faucet, and we think little about it beyond this point of contact. We have lost a sense of respect for the wild river, for the complex workings of a wetland, for the intricate web of life that water supports”

It is a profound, thought provoking work, offering deep insights about JK as a seeker and a poet. The final lines of the poem are in this photograph and I have taken the liberty to quote it in its entirety;
I have no name;
I am as the fresh breeze of the mountains.
I have no shelter;
I am as the wandering waters.
I have no sanctuary, like the dark gods;
Nor am I in the shadow of deep temples.
I have no sacred books;
Nor am I well-seasoned in tradition.
I am not in the incense burning upon the high altars;
Nor in the pomp of ceremonies.
I am neither in the graven image;
Nor in the rich chant of a melodious voice.
I am not bound by theories;
Nor corrupted by beliefs.
I am not held in the bondage of religions;
Nor in the pious agony of their priests.
I am not entrapped by philosophies;
Nor held in the power of their sects.
I am neither low nor high;
I am the worshipper and the worshipped.
I am free.
My song is the song of the river calling for the open seas;
Wandering, wandering;

06/02/24, 8:59 am - Dr Raguram: Farid ud-Din Attar was considered by Rumi to be “the master of sufi poetry”. The “Conference of the Birds” by him is an engaging parable about the mystical quest for the Truth. It features a host of birds led by the hoopoe, who acts as their spiritual guide in their quest. In their journey, the birds travel through the seven valleys of the quest, love, understanding, independence and detachment, unity, astonishment, and finally to a state of nothingness. In this allegorical text, many of us can locate ourselves amidst these different valleys. 
Let us strive to head to the words of the Hoopoe;
“The ocean can be yours; why should you stop  
Beguiled by dreams of evanescent dew?”

flicker of shade and sunlight

08/02/24, 8:53 am - Dr Raguram: In one of the safaris in Kanha, the driver took us on a dirt track, away from other vehicles. As I was soaking in the soothing ambiance of the forest, I noticed a tiger just ahead of us. He kept us company for over the next fifteen minutes. Suddenly he stopped right in front of us. He was looking at me and our eyes locked. His stunning eyes never wavered. I experienced a profound connection through that intense gaze. I was immersed in listening to the unspoken language of his eyes. At that moment I understood what Martin Buber (whose birthday is today) meant when he commented that "An animal's eyes have the power to speak a great language." It is a powerful reminder that the most fulfilling and genuine moments in life are found through the act of connecting deeply with another being.

11/02/24, 8:50 am - Dr Raguram: London is full of blue plaques. They dot the walls of buildings throughout London, marking the places where scientists, artists, politicians and activists who lived and worked there. When I was on a Commonwealth Fellowship, I made it a point to visit as many of them. One address I was keen to locate was No 1, Fitzroy Road where WB Yeats lived for a while. It was also the building where Sylvia Plath, a poet whom I admire deeply, spent her last days before ending her life on February 11th 1963.
Poets die young and not so often by suicide. Perhaps the act of writing poetry fascinates the wounded and in the process also opens up fresh wounds. Syvia Plath was no exception. In her thinly veiled autobiographical novel, ‘Bell Jar’, she wrote, “Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forgive life, to be at peace”. Pensive by disposition, she kept ruminating about it, which found expression in these lines which she wrote ten days before ending her life:
“The blood jet is poetry,
There is no stopping it”.
There are a multitude of ways in which Sylvia Plath’s life and her final act has been analyzed and debated. Beyond these lenses of scrutiny her existential angst was enmeshed in a troubled past and a tumultuous relationship with her husband Ted Hughes. Perhaps the most insightful and poignant account about Syliva Plath’s suicide was by her friend A Alvarez in his book, ‘The Savage God’, which we reviewed in NIMHANS in the late 70s. In the first page of the book, there is a quote by Cesare Pavese, regarded as one of Italy's most important twentieth-century poets, which says it all:"No one ever lacks a good reason for suicide."

12/02/24, 8:08 am - Dr Raguram: In a series of groundbreaking studies conducted in the late 1930s, psychologist Kurt Lewin (who was born on this day), identified three core styles of leadership; Authoritarian (autocratic) leadership. Participative (democratic) leadership and Delegative (laissez-faire) leadership.
Over the past decade we are witnessing the rise of populist, authoritarian, strong-man politicians across the globe. Its seductive appeal necessitates a detailed sociological enquiry! However, a political leadership that rules on the basis of fear, threat, intimidation, and advocating one worldview as superior while silencing diversity of opinions and dissent is in my opinion will lead to fragmentation of society. Unfortunately an authoritarian world view is not confined to the political arena. It seeps into and influences people's attitudes, impacts institutional ethos in centres of learning and more importantly, festers lack of trust. The more we portray the ‘others’ as threat, the greater the harm to the fabric that binds and holds us all together.  
The harmful impact of authoritarian attitude in a leader is accentuated once it is tinged with narcissistic traits, resulting in an overwhelming need for control with an inflated sense of self-worth. They strongly adhere to the  belief that they should be in charge and expect others to conform to their views and desires, often holding people with differing viewpoints in contempt. These leaders insist on strict conformity to their beliefs and tend to view the world in binary terms; you are either with them or against them. This black-and-white perspective creates a hostile environment where individuals are categorized as friends or foes based on their willingness to conform. Such a rigid stance stifles open dialogue and learning from others. 
As George Orwell observed presciently in 1984, it leads to “processions, meetings, military parades, lectures, waxwork displays, film shows, telescreen programs all had to be organized; stands had to be erected, effigies built, slogans coined, songs written, rumours circulated, photographs faked.”

13/02/24, 8:35 am - Dr Raguram: Sarojini Naidu, born on 13th February 1879,  was one of the most outstanding figures of the independence movement. An equally talented poet in English, she was known as “The Nightingale of India”. Her poetry brims with strong emotions expressed in lyrical verses. An ardent admirer of nature, she was also a great lover of birds. 
I am particularly drawn (given my passion for them!) to her poem ‘Bird of Time’, wherein she expresses the workings of time through the movements of a bird. Just as we don’t expect a bird to be still, time too is fleeting. Life and death, sorrow and hope, time encompasses them all in this poem.
BIRD OF TIME
O Bird of Time on your fruitful bough
What are the songs you sing? …
Songs of the glory and gladness of life,
Of poignant sorrow and passionate strife,
And the lilting joy of the spring;
Of hope that sows for the years unborn,
And faith that dreams of a tarrying morn,
The fragrant peace of the twilight’s breath,
And the mystic silence that men call death.

O Bird of Time, say where did you learn
The changing measures you sing? …
In blowing forests and breaking tides,
In the happy laughter of new-made brides,
And the nests of the new-born spring;
In the dawn that thrills to a mother’s prayer,
And the night that shelters a heart’s despair,
In the sigh of pity, the sob of hate,
And the pride of a soul that has conquered fate.
In one of last letters she wrote, ” While I live, it will always be the supreme desire of my Soul to write poetry —one poem, one line of enduring verse even. Perhaps I shall die without realising that longing which is at once an exquisite joy and an unspeakable anguish to me”.

16/02/24, 8:39 am - Dr Raguram: Nicheren (February 16, 1222 - November 14, 1282) was one of the most influential Japanese  priests who preached tenets of Mahayana Buddhism. An important sutra of Mahayana Buddhism is the ‘Lotus Sutra’ which was written between 100 B.C. and 200 A.D. Already well known in India, it became one of the important sutras of Chinese Buddhism and later in Japan.. 
It is named the ‘Lotus Sutra’ because the lotus symbolises the oneness of cause and effect since the lotus is a flower that blooms and seeds at the same time. Moreover, it also signifies  the purity of Buddhahood, blooming in the midst of our ordinary lives just as the lotus blossoms in muddy pond water. What the ‘Lotus Sutra’ essentially emphasizes  is that all living beings, whether they realize it or not, have the capacity to become enlightened. Everyone, without exception, can unlock the perfect wisdom and great compassion that reside in the depths of life. 
Nichiren established the practice of reciting the ‘Lotus Sutra's’ title,” Nam-myoho-renge-kyo”, to make the path to enlightenment accessible to all. It is no ordinary phrase and is the essence of the entire ‘Lotus Sutra’. The phrase "Namu-myoho-renge-kyo" literally translates to "I take refuge in the Lotus of the Wonderful Law". Nam: Comes from the Sanskrit word namas, which means to devote or dedicate oneself. Myo: is usually translated as wonderful. Ho: Means law. Renge, meaning lotus blossom. The lotus flower is pure and fragrant, unsullied by the muddy water in which it grows. Similarly, the beauty and dignity of our humanity is brought forth amidst the sufferings of daily lives. Kyo literally means sutra. Chanting the mantra is called daimoku. The purpose of chanting daimoku is to attain perfect and complete awakening. It is an expression of determination, to embrace and realize our Buddha nature. Nichiren taught that to chant “Nam-myoho-renge-kyo” is to bring forth the Buddhahood that exists inherently within all of us.

17/02/24, 7:57 am - Dr Raguram: In the 60s Eshwari Lending Library in Chennai was my stomping ground. One day I picked up a book ‘The Chosen’ by Chaim Potok, sheerly by chance. When I started reading it, I was put off initially by an extensive description of a baseball match in the first 30 pages of the book. I persisted nevertheless and couldn’t put the book down after that. The novel opened me up to another time and another world which I was not familiar with,till then. 
It is a story about two Jewish teens from different backgrounds; Reuven Malter, hailing from an Orthodox family and Danny Sanders from a Hasidic background. It details the bond between the two and the relationship each has with his father. Relationships between fathers and sons figure prominently in ‘The Chosen’, especially in the choices of the sons' careers. Danny's father expects him to become a rabbi and leader of his Hasidic sect, following the tradition of generations, while Reuven's father lets him choose his own path. Daniel has decided not to become a Tzaddik, but to follow his heart, attend graduate school and become a psychologist. Reuven has made up his mind to become a Rabbi, despite his great talent for logic and mathematics. Reuven and Danny both have one thing in common, trying to decide on whether they should be something that was chosen for them or something they want to be.
I had just finished PUC at the time I read the book and was drawn to the main theme of the book, ‘Choosing and Being Chosen’. Hailing from a family wherein my grandfather was a well known doctor, the implicit expectation was that I should follow his path. I wasn’t so sure at that time as I was drawn more to liberal arts. Perhaps I was ‘chosen’ to become a doctor and that too a psychiatrist!
When I read this book again, I was particularly drawn to this passage in the book, “Human beings do not live forever… We live less than the time it takes to blink an eye, if we measure against eternity.  So it may be asked what value is there to a human life.  There is so much pain in the world. What does it mean to suffer so much if our lives are nothing more than the blink of an eye?…  I learned a long time ago … that a blink of an eye in itself is nothing.  But the eye that blinks, that is something.  A span of life is nothing.  But the man who lives that span, he is something.  He can fill that tiny span with meaning, so its quality is immeasurable though its quantity may be insignificant.  …  A man must fill his life with meaning, meaning is not automatically given to life”.

18/02/24, 8:26 am - Dr Raguram: Another book I had picked up those days at Easwari lending library was the novel ‘Zorba the Greek’. Much like ‘The Chosen’, it is the story of two men: Zorba, a Greek working man and a wealthy, young narrator and their incredible friendship. The two of them  couldn’t be further apart. The narrator is cerebral, modest, and reserved; Zorba is unfettered and spirited.The younger man reads all day. He’s an aficionado of Buddhist philosophy, the exact opposite world view of Zorba who has such lust for life. These two characters represent two distinct ways of life. The implicit question throughout the book: which is better? Being a “stable” person and being accepted and respected in society, or being an indulgent  person living his life full. Both are searching for answers. The Narrator has a  desire to change, but he adamantly resists Zorba’s philosophy, despite admitting to admiring it and  wishing he could assimilate it with his own. The relationship between these two characters symbolizes the conversation between the head and the heart, the mind and the spirit, what Nietzsche referred to as the Apollonian and the Dionysian impulses. Kazantzakis masterfully interweaves these dual perspectives of human nature. The book is also an important reminder to embrace the transience of life, to seize the moments that bring us joy, unfettered by intellectual curiosity. A passage in the book by the narrator illustrates this perspective:
“I remember one morning when I discovered a cocoon in the back of a  tree just as a butterfly was making a hole in its case and preparing  to come out. I waited a while, but it was too long appearing and I was impatient. I bent over it and breathed on it to warm it. I warmed it as quickly as I could and the miracle began to happen before my eyes faster than life. The case opened; the butterfly started slowly crawling out, and I shall never forget my horror when I saw how its wings were folded back and crumpled; the wretched butterfly tried with its whole trembling body to unfold them. Bending over it, I tried  to help it with my breath, in vain.  It needed to be hatched out patiently and the unfolding of the wings  should be a gradual process in the sun. Now it was too late. My breath had forced the butterfly to appear all crumpled, before its time. It struggled desperately and, a few seconds later, died in the palm of my hand. That little body is, I do believe, the greatest weight I have on my  conscience. For, I realize today that it is a mortal sin to violate great laws of nature. We should not hurry, we should not be impatient, but we should confidently obey the external rhythm”.
A viewpoint summarized in the gravestone of the author, Nikos Kazantzakis,"I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free."
(And who can forget Anthony Quinn bringing the most life-affirming character of Zorba alive  in the movie version of the book with the Zorba the Greek song brimming with life?)

20/02/24, 8:28 am - Dr Raguram: When I visited Yosemite sometime ago, I felt overwhelmed with the enormous expanse of its enchanting landscape. It was much like losing myself in a vast heritage temple which was built aeons ago. I felt humbled in the presence of its towering granite cliffs, lush meadows, forested valleys and dramatic seasonal waterfalls. It was a mystical experience. 
One person who brought out its magical realm in tangible ways for us to relish was Anselm Adams, whose birthday is today. Yosemite was Ansel Adam’s muse.When he looked through his camera lens, he saw more than it's rocks, trees, and rivers. He saw art. Adams explored and recorded the grandeur of nature in stunning black and white photographs,conveying its beauty in lyrical ways. His elegant compositions with tantalizing play of light across its incredible terrain exude a certain sense of calmness. 
As Adams observed, “The whole world is, to me, very much alive, all the little growing things, even the rocks…I can’t look at a swell bit of grass and earth, for instance, without feeling the essential life, the things going on, within them”.

Vinatha will lose patience and forcefully break open the shell from where the child is born handicapped. She will learn the lesson and wait patiently for the second who is Vainatheya very powerful and releases his mother from curse!!

22/02/24, 8:06 am - Dr Raguram: Takahama Kyoshi (born on 22nd February1874) was a great haiku poet in the history of modern Japanese haiku literature. He wrote more than two hundred thousand haikus in his lifetime. 
He defined haiku as the poetry of ‘ka-cho-fuhei’, literally meaning “an elegant way of describing bird and flower”. Not surprisingly then, nature in all manifestations figure prominently in his haikus.
One day Kyoshi was sweeping his garden, trying to get rid of cobwebs. To his great dismay, when he  returned later, he found another spider had spun a new web. Though annoyed for a second, he realized that it is the natural behaviour of the spider to keep spinning webs. In a moment, he identified with the spider. He himself has to keep creating haiku as long as he lives, much like the spider. That's the call and beauty of life.
And he sat down and wrote this beautiful haiku:
“Born as a spider
No choice but to spin
His spider web”
The spider is aware that the web it spins will not last long. Yet it doesn’t tire itself in spinning one. The cadence of our existence is in lending an ear to the melody of life’s ephemeral quality and embracing it.
In the timeless words of Gulzar:
“आने वाला पल , जाने वाला है
हो सके तो इस में
ज़िदंगी बिता दो
पल जो ये जाने वाला है”

23/02/24, 8:44 am - Dr Raguram: For a long time I shied away reading, ‘The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich’, as the very thought of reading about a misanthropic, racist, megalomaniac ruler who caused so much human misery, was sheer anathema for me.
I dipped into the book several years later. Usually I read books at a stretch, but not with this voluminous one spread over a thousand pages. 
Once I finished reading it, my first thought was one of appreciation about the author, William Shirer, whose birthday is today. A talented journalist, he had interviewed Mahatma Gandhi several times and wrote an interesting book about these encounters.
But nothing prepared him for the demonic, spellbinding charisma he witnessed when he took up residence in Berlin in 1934 where he began to chronicle the rise of the Third Reich under Adolf Hitler. His contempt is not for Hitler so much as for the “little men of German”, for the culture that acceded to Hitler and Nazism so readily
Charlemagne is often considered as Germany’s First Reich. He was followed by the Second Reich, Bismarck who felt betrayed by the supposed treachery of Jews. When all of Germany was awaiting the Third Reich as a saviour, Adolf Hitler stepped in. 
Shirer is mainly concerned with charting the rise to power of this ruthless man, how he bullied and threatened his way to convince a large population, which was unreflectively taken by his promise of a ‘Thousand Year Reich’, which only lasted a total of 12 years, 4 months, and 8 days. But during that brief span it wrought havoc and destruction on a scale never witnessed before, that resulted in their own ruin.
Shirer is no historian. As he observed, “Journalism is the first draft of history”, His scrutinizing lens is that of an observant journalist. There is no overarching historical explanation of the Third Reich, but a rich account of its rise and fall.
The book is a reminder that there is danger in giving up our sense of selfhood for the illusory unity of a frenzied mass movement, championed by a narcissistic, charismatic leader.
Couple of quotes to reflect upon from the book:
“The broad masses of a population are more amenable to the appeal of rhetoric than to any other force”.
“With a shrewdness that never deserted him Hitler carefully calculated the precipitation of one crisis upon another so that he was always moving in the driver's seat at the center of the stage”.
“The most dangerous people in the world are not those who carry guns and bombs, but those who carry blind hatred in their hearts”.
And lastly:
“Doubt is the beginning of wisdom”.

24/02/24, 8:05 am - Dr Raguram: Sometime ago I had posted about the intriguing interface between the private and the public self.
Jorge Luis Borges, whom I admire deeply, wrote the shortest of short stories, ‘Borges and I’. It is a fascinating read, raising an interesting question, “Is Borges the man or  Borges the writer”? When a writer articulates his experiences and expresses them on paper,does he assume a different persona? In an essay which he wrote in 1919, TS Eliot wondered whether, “the more perfect the artist, the more completely separate in him will be the man who suffers and the mind which creates”. Borges is a lover of paradox and doesn’t attempt to ‘resolve’ this question. His story ends tantalizingly with these words, “I do not know which of us has written this page”.
BORGES and I
The other one, the one called Borges], is the one things happen to. I walk through the streets of Buenos Aires and stop for a moment, perhaps mechanically now, to look at the arch of an entrance hall and the grillwork on the gate; I know of Borges from the mail and see his name on a list of professors or in a biographical dictionary. I like hourglasses, maps, eighteenth-century typography, the taste of coffee and the prose of Stevenson; he shares these preferences, but in a vain way that turns them into the attributes of an actor. It would be an exaggeration to say that ours is a hostile relationship; I live, let myself go on living, so that Borges may contrive his literature, and this literature justifies me. It is no effort for me to confess that he has achieved some valid pages, but those pages cannot save me], perhaps because what is good belongs to no one, not even to him, but rather to the language and to tradition. Besides, I am destined to perish,definitely and only some instant of myself can survive in him. Little by little, I am giving over everything to him, though I am quite aware of his perverse custom of falsifying and magnifying things].
Spinoza knew that all things long to persist in their being; the stone eternally wants to be a stone and the tiger a tiger. I shall remain in Borges, not in myself (if it is true that I am someone), but I recognize myself less in his books than in many others or in the laborious strumming of a guitar. Years ago I tried to free myself from him and went from the mythologies of the suburbs to the games with time and infinity, but those games belong to Borges now and I shall have to imagine other things. Thus my life is a flight and I lose everything and everything belongs to oblivion, or to him.
I do not know which of us has written this page.

25/02/24, 8:59 am - Dr Raguram: Both Ahalya and myself are ardent Beatles aficionados. We must have listened to ‘Sgt.Peppers Lonely Heart Club’ umpteen number of times. Each time it is a revelation of the group’s immense talents and originality. Each and every song in it is a gem, Amidst them, the  ‘Within and Without You’, stands out for its melodious tones inspired by Indian music.George Harrison (whose birthday is today) was learning sitar from Pandit Ravi Shankar at that time and used it in the song beautifully. The tune was partially based on a lengthy suite Shankar had written for All-India Radio.It has a sinuous quality and its sweeping tunes cast a spell.
One can consider this song as the most philosophical in the entire album. George was quite influenced by the book, ‘Autobiography of a Yogi’, by Paramahamsa Yogananda. Its underlying theme is the importance of self knowledge. in order for a person to freely love and realize self-knowledge, he/she must become less attached to the things of the world which might deter him from reaching such a state. Harrison is encouraging the listener to go “within” themselves. And at the same time, in order to successfully do so one has to be “without” himself. And to be “without” himself involves casting aside one’s worldly concerns. In essence, this is one of the well-recognized aspects for effective meditative practice.
When you've seen beyond yourself
Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you

27/02/24, 8:07 am - Dr Raguram: A good poem opens up a new world and takes you on a memorable journey. Henry Wadswoth Longfellow’s, ‘Nature’ is one such. 
The simple, unpretentious opening lines of the poem portray a familiar scene that happens in most of our homes; a mother trying to put her child to sleep. The child’s ‘broken playthings’ are scattered on the floor, and he is  “half willing" to abandon the play and retire for the night. He lingers, staring longingly at the toys he has left behind.
The next few lines venture into a new territory all together. The poet compares the  mother whom he just described eloquently, to mother nature. Both are essentially caretakers of all of us. Nature is to man, what a mother is to her child. As we advance in years, nature gradually takes away all our earthly possessions and gently guides us to the world beyond. Since often we are greatly attached to our earthly life and our belongings, we are never too willing to proceed towards that goal. But nature leads us just like the mother leading the child to sleep,taking away our "playthings" one at a time. The poet suggests that our earthly desires and attachments are like playthings that we must eventually relinquish to discover the unknown mysteries of life..
Why did this poem appeal to me? I was drawn (and still continue to be!) by the simple imagery of a mother putting a reluctant child to sleep, which slowly blends itself into a very powerful metaphor of a nurturing nature that prepares us for our journey beyond this world. There is much wisdom in these lines;
NATURE
As a fond mother, when the day is o'er,
   Leads by the hand her little child to bed,
   Half willing, half reluctant to be led,
   And leave his broken playthings on the floor,
Still gazing at them through the open door,
   Nor wholly reassured and comforted
   By promises of others in their stead,
   Which, though more splendid, may not please him more;
So Nature deals with us, and takes away
   Our playthings one by one, and by the hand
   Leads us to rest so gently, that we go
Scarce knowing if we wish to go or stay,
   Being too full of sleep to understand
   How far the unknown transcends the what we know.
(Henry Wadswoth Longfellow born on this day on 1807)

29/02/24, 8:03 am - Dr Raguram: Tore Ørjasæter (March 3rd,1886 - February 29th1968) was a Norwegian poet who was rooted in the folk tradition and wrote many lyrical poems about nature. Unfortunately only very few of them have been translated into English. Cries of Gulls is one such gem:
CRIES OF GULLS
Sheer rock and steep faces of Lofot,
bird-cliff and thousands
of seagulls that circle round mast and hull.
Let themselves glide on powerful wings
towards the open sea, - it breathes towards them
and receives like an open mind.
Soon after the storm has abated,
the sea’s bosom still goes on heaving.
The swell lifts the heavy sea
closer up to the horizon
that constantly escapes and dies out quietly
to new heights on the skyline
that once more breathes out and escapes
like time dies out within the age.
Oh these free cries of gulls
towards the open sea! It is like breathing
out one’s longings and never landing.

01/03/24, 9:04 am - Dr Raguram: Rhythmic highs and lows of life can spark the creative urge within ourselves. But when the intensity of the swings are severe, it causes immense suffering to those in the midst of it. Rober Lowell, whose birthday is today, suffered from a severe form of bipolar illness which started early in his life. Mental illness ran deep in his family and his life was laden with instability; for thirty years he was in and out of mental hospitals. The manic episodes were extremely disruptive with florid psychotic symptoms, requiring hospitalization, which were invariably followed by periods of depression. 
Fire is a central image in Lowell’s works. His manic episodes were akin to a blaze of fire which took some effect to be quelled. He wrote, “By the time I reached the hospital I was completely out of my head—strange physical sensations—I was a prophet and everything was a symbol; then in the hospital: shouting, singing, tearing things up—religion and antics. Then depression (extreme) aching, self-enclosed, fearful of everyone and everything anyone could do, feeling I was nothing and could do nothing” He termed his manic phase as the “holocaust of irrationality” and depression as the “long, burdensome dull period” with months of “wading in the muck and weeds and backwash of a depression. Depression is an illness for oneself, mania an illness for one’s friends”.
Above all, he was a poet and during one of his admissions, he wrote: 
The resident doctor said,
“We are not deep in ideas, imagination, or enthusiasm—
how can we help you?”
I asked,
“These days of only poems and depression—
what can I do with them?
Will they help me notice
what I cannot bear to look at?” 
Lowell wrote brilliantly about the embers of his illness in an autobiographical piece, “Near the Unbalanced Aquarium”, which is included in his book ‘Memoirs’. The effect of the medication was “like the slowing and ache of a medium fever. One’s thoughts are not directly changed and healed, but the terrible, over-riding restlessness of one’s system is halted so that the mind can see life as it is”. He was given Lithium much later in his life, once it was available for use. Among all the medications and ECTs that were given to him, Lowell found that Lithium was the most effective one. Reflecting about it, hw wondered to his friend, “It's terrible, Bob, to think that all I’ve suffered, and all the suffering I’ve caused, might have arisen from the lack of a little salt in my brain”
What is remarkable is that Lowell continued writing despite the immense suffering due to his mood disorder which wreaked on his life. His courage and determination enabled him to channel the creative fire within, which unfortunately consumed him. 
(There have been many biographies of Robert Lowell, my personal favourite is the exceptional,l ‘Setting the River on Fire’, by Kay Redfeld Jamison)

03/03/24, 8:02 am - Dr Raguram: Humans and wildlife have interacted closely for millions of years, especially during the prehistoric era. The habitat of the prehistoric people were caves. Dwelling there, they embellished the caves with paintings imbued with natural colours. A common theme in their paintings was wildlife, which was not surprising since they lived in close proximity with them. Wildlife was an integral part of their daily lives.  
I had the first glimpse of the richness of the prehistoric cave paintings ranging from the Upper Paleolithic period (around 30,000 years ago) to the mediaeval period, in Bhimbetka. It is one of the most densely painted rock shelters in India. As I walked into its vast terrain, one particular rock shelter caught my attention, which is often referred to as the Zoo Rock. A vast array of various wild animals, painted in profile, covered its rock face. Deers, elephants, leopards, wild buffaloes, bears and boars were galloping on its aged backdrop. The primary colour was white, which dates back  to the Mesolithic period, while a few from later periods were mostly in red. Though the colours had faded with time, the entire scene was brimming with energy, showcasing the close relationship between these ancient painters and the wildlife around them. 
Unfortunately this relationship has frayed over time. The global loss of wildlife is significantly alrarming. According to a 2022 World Wildlife Fund report, global wildlife populations have declined by 69% since 1970.
I am reminded of the story, ‘The Epic of Gilgamesh’, which narrates the great city builder Gilgamesh’s friendship with a “wild man,” Enkidu. Enkidu leads a contented life without human contact, “coated in hair like the god of the animals,” grazing at the water hole with a herd of gazelles, “his heart delighting with the beasts in the water.” Gilgamesh forcibly humanizes Enkidu by sending Shamhat, a priestess, to seduce him. After many days of lovemaking, Enkidu is spurned by the wild animals. He gets a haircut, eats bread, drinks ale and returns with Shamhat to the city.
As modern city dwellers, we are much like the alienated Enkidu, estranged from the rich wildlife around us, making occasional forays to have a glimpse of them amidst the declining forest covers. On the occasion of World Wildlife day and on the background of increasing man-animal conflicts, can we cultivate a more mindful interaction with wild animals at a both personal and  public level and commit ourselves towards sustained conservation and peaceful coexistence?
(And of course, you can see them all at ‘Vantara’…relocated and displaced from their natural habitat. Is that the future of wildlife in India?!)

04/03/24, 8:37 am - Dr Raguram: I went for the interview in JIPMER, preparing  myself for all kinds of questions that could be asked in the ‘subjects’. When I stepped in with much trepidation into the room, I was overwhelmed by the presence of half a dozen serious looking gentlemen. An imposing man seated in the centre looked at me and asked, “Young man, why do you want to study medicine?” Without hesitation, I blurted “because I love literature”. The response was on the spur of the moment, totally unrehearsed. My answer must have surprised him and he asked me to mention physicians who were also writers. I spoke for a few minutes about Anton Chekov, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and William Carlos William, amongst others. It was much later that I discovered that the gentleman who asked me the question was the venerable writer GK Gokak who later became President of the Sahithya Academy.
There is always an interesting tryst between the professional call and the personal passion and sometimes they converge. A long list of physician-writers down the ages right from the mediaeval physician, Maimonides, down to Abraham Verghese in recent times, will bear testimony to this. 
William Carlos Williams was a pediatrician and general practitioner. He "worked harder at being a writer than he did at being a physician," His enormous output ranges across short stories, poems, plays, novels, critical essays and an autobiography. In his ‘Doctor Stories’, he gave a glimpse of work; hysterical mothers, obstinate children and poor families with nine kids unable to spare a few dollars for his services. There is an unflinching, straightforward tone in his stories. All the while, he was diligently mining his material for his true call, poetry. 
His poems are simple, spare, with striking imagery. For instance, his lengthy poem, ‘Birds and Flowers’ ends with these beautiful words;
“Though the eye
turns inward, the mind
has spread its embrace — in
a wind that
roughs the stiff petals —
More! the particular flower is
blossoming . . “.

For me, one of the pleasures of travelling by the tube was to read the poems that used to adorn the stations. Simply called, ‘Poems from the underground’, it was a veritable collection of verses from across the world. It was also a wonderful introduction to poets whom I neve heard of before. One such poet was Anise Koltz, often referred to as “the great lady of Luxembourg literature.” These particular lines of her, which I had made a note of, were particularly striking.
THE BIRDS WILL STILL SING
“Break my branches
saw me into bits
the birds will still sing
in my roots”
Birds inhabit the same world we do, and yet, they seem capable of transcending it. Though many of them lead lives on the brink of ruin, they still sing. These sparse, powerful, words in the poem convey that even in the midst of destruction unleashed by humans, spirited voices will emerge, rooted in resilience.

06/03/24, 8:43 am - Dr Raguram: Georgia O'Keeffe was one of the first female painters to achieve worldwide acclaim.She struggled with depression and anxiety throughout her life. In the midst of it all, she connected with several others who were going through similar psychological tribulations and also got in touch with Frida Kahlo. These connections helped her immensely in her healing process. She also found solace and inspiration in nature. Over the course of her illustrious career she painted around 200 images of flowers, focusing on their innards. Many critics, largely males, claimed that these images were replete with sexual symbolism,which O’Keefee denied vehemently stating that she had only painted the blooms she saw. It is hard to say exactly what O’Keeffe intended to symbolise in her flower paintings. Nevertheless, they are the most iconic images imbued with  undulating forms and soft gradations of tones, exuding a mystical quality. 
In O’Keeffe’s own words: “When you take a flower in your hand and really look at it, it’s your world for the moment. Most people in the city rush around so they have no time to look at a flower. I want them to see it whether they want to or not.”

According to one, it was the day when Shiva drank the poison that emerged from the ocean during Amritmanthan, to protect the world. He drank it but held it in his throat instead of swallowing it. Thus, his throat changed to a blue colour and he was then given the name, Nilkantha. According to another legend, when Ganga was descended from heaven after the request of Bhagirath, it was enormous and uncontrollable, so Lord Brahma requested Shiva to control her fall. Shiva agreed to it and he held the rapid flow of Ganga by tying it up in his hair. According to yet another legend, this was the night when Shiva and Parvati got married, an amalgamation of Purusha (mindfulness) and Prakriti (nature). 
I have a particular interest in the mural tradition of south India and went over to the Virupaksha temple sometime back to have a look at the murals that adorn the ranga mantapa. It was fascinating to see the ceiling resplendent with murals depicting scenes from the purana and various narrative episodes from history. Prominent among them is a large panel depicting the marriage of Shiva and Parvati. In the attached photo, starting from the left, one can find Narada, a horse headed Tumburu.. Vishnu and Lakshmi are in the next section. The middle portion depicts the marriage of Shiva and Parvati in exquisite detail.. Brahma is officiating the marriage of Shiva and Parvati with Himavat performing Kanyadan. Three bejewelled women are seen on their right. In the last section on the right, one can notice the three legged Bhringi. The attention to detail, especially the designs in the textiles is quite striking. I was wondering as to how these murals would have looked in their heyday. Temples are not merely places of worship; embellished with magnificent sculptures and paintings, they are repositories of a rich aesthetic tradition which needs to be preserved and protected. I was happy to note that an innovative attempt has been made to digitise these murals. There is an overwhelming need for similar initiatives to conserve many such artistic treasures across the country, which are unfortunately in various stages of neglect.

09/03/24, 8:55 am - Dr Raguram: There have been many fictionalized accounts of child abuse. Almost all of them are very unsettling to read as they deal with one of the most harrowing aspects of human behaviour.
Keri Hulme’s ‘The Bone People’, is one such. It was the first work of fiction from New Zealand to win the Booker Prize.
There are three main characters in the novel: a person modelled after the author, a widower who finds and adopts a young mute boy and, finally, the child. It becomes clear quite early that the child suffered abuse even before he was found with no memory on a beach. Unfortunately, he is also abused by his adoptive father. The novel deals with guilt vs impulse for violence of the father, the trauma of the child and the woman's debate over the acceptability of this behaviour. The novel offers a moving, intimate insight into the lives of these three flawed, struggling people. The descriptions of child abuse are quite gut renching.
Ker Hulme took twelve years to write it and it was rejected by many before it was published by a women’s collective. It has a rambling style, switching between first persona and third person narratives, interspersed with poetry. 
It is not a perfect novel, much like the flawed characters it portrays, but there is an unmistakable originality in narration. Some of the imagery in this novel is absolutely breathtaking and there are poetic, evocative descriptions of the New Zealand coastline :
“The color has faded out of the sky. It is grey, becoming darker as the world turns herself round a little more. The clouds are long and black and ragged, like the wings of storm battered dragons.”

10/03/24, 8:49 am - Dr Raguram: MEDITATION ON THE AUTUMN LEAF
Thich Nhat Hanh
"I asked the leaf whether it was frightened because it was Autumn and the other leaves were falling.
The leaf told me, “No. During the whole Spring and Summer I was completely alive. I worked hard to help nourish the tree, and now much of me is in the tree. I am not limited by this form. I am also the whole tree, and when I go back to the soil, I will continue to nourish the tree. So I don’t worry at all. As I leave this branch and float to the ground, I will wave to the tree and tell her, ‘I will see you again very soon.”
That day there was a wind blowing and, after a while, I saw the leaf leave the branch and float down to the soil, dancing joyfully, because as it floated it saw itself already there in the tree. It was so happy. I bowed my head, knowing that I have a lot to learn from the leaf.” 
” … So please continue to look back and you will see that you have always been here. Let us look together and penetrate into the life of a leaf, so we may be one with the leaf. Let us penetrate and be one with the cloud or with the wave, to realize our own nature as water and be free from our fear. If we look very deeply, we will transcend birth and death.
Tomorrow, I will continue to be. But you will have to be very attentive to see me. I will be a flower, or a leaf. I will be in these forms and I will say hello to you. If you are attentive enough, you will recognize me, and you may greet me. I will be very happy."

12/03/24, 9:27 am - Dr Raguram: Nijinsky was an extraordinarily talented ballet dancer. Unfortunately he had to weather the storm of schizophrenia during a major part of his life. I have penned a few thoughts on his birthday at: https://www.profraguram.com/musings--reflections/vaslav-nijisnsky-and-his-tryst-with-schizophrenia.

15/03/24, 8:02 am - Dr Raguram: WS Merwin was a widely celebrated poet, winner of two Pulitzers and the  poet laureate of America. He wrote 26 books of poetry, eight books of prose and translated 22 more, including Neruda's love poems, He was a practising Buddhist and a passionate proponent of deep ecology. Merwin lived on an old pineapple plantation in Hawaii which he painstakingly restored to its original rainforest state and died there on 15th March 2019.
Merwin’s poems may seem to be simple. As you read them, the words take hold of you. The sentences come alive, with beautiful imagery of the world around us. “I don't like using the word environment," he commented. "I don't like the word nature. I don't like using them because they make it seem as though we're not nature. Anything we do to the rest of the world we're doing to ourselves."
Sometimes while birding, when I hear the song of a bird which I haven’t heard before I keep wondering as to what it could be. It lingers on as a mystery in my memory. Merwin uses this imagery evocatively in this poem, drawing attention to the wonder and mystery of the ‘unknown’.
THE UNKNOWN BIRD
Out of the dry days
through the dusty leaves
far across the valley
those few notes never
heard here before

one fluted phrase
floating over its
wandering secret
all at once wells up
somewhere else

and is gone before it
goes on fallen into
its own echo leaving
a hollow through the air
that is dry as before

where is it from
hardly anyone
seems to have noticed it
so far but who now
would have been listening

it is not native here
that may be the one
thing we are sure of
it came from somewhere
else perhaps alone

so keeps on calling for
no one who is here
hoping to be heard
by another of its own
unlikely origin

trying once more the same few
notes that began the song
of an oriole last heard
years ago in another
existence there

it goes again tell
no one it is here
foreign as we are
who are filling the days
with a sound of our own

20/03/24, 7:59 am - Dr Raguram: As I watch through my window, the snowflakes are whirling and falling on the ground with fluffy lightness. Soon, they cover the ground, forming a dainty, white blanket.
I feel oneness with these gyrating crystals. Immersed in the experience, I become aware of  my own thoughts that arise and fall within myself. They are the visual hieroglyphic representations of multitudes of thoughts swirling within my mind. In these moments I am not just an observer of the world outside my window, but an explorer of my internal landscape.The falling snow becomes a companion in my journey, like a wandering minstrel.

21/03/24, 8:33 am - Dr Raguram: 20th March is celebrated as World Sparrow Day. On this day I would like to share a story about the Pine tree and the Sparrow from the Cherokee folklore.
Back when the world was young and all of the animals and trees could talk to each other, winter was on the anvil. The Sparrow was injured and was not strong enough to fly away, so he sent his family on to the Southern regions and decided to stay behind and heal. Since he was injured he knew he would not survive the winter without shelter. So he asked various trees for help.
Sparrow went from tree to tree asking them to shelter him in the cold months. One by one they gave him excuses and refused to give him shelter. There was only one tree left, the lowly Pine tree. So with no hope left Sparrow made his plea to the Pine tree. Sparrow said "Pine, I am injured and not able to fly south, would you let me shelter in your branches until my family returns?"
Pine was a humble tree and thought to himself  "What can I do?" but his heart heard the plight of Sparrow and said "My branches are small and my leaves are more like needles but you are welcome to be with me." And so Sparrow spent the cold winter with Pine tree. 
Spring came and when the Creator saw what had happened he called a council of the trees and said to them. "You who have so much and would not share with Sparrow will now lose your leaves in the cold time.  But Pine, because you gave so much you shall keep your leaves in the coldtime.” 
And that is why the Pine tree keeps its green cover throughout the year. 
It is a reminder that in our professional lives we come across many who are like the injured Sparrow, in search of a shelter to heal.  It behoves us to offer them space to recoup and recover so that they can bring their journey afresh, with renewed hope.

22/03/24, 6:47 am - Dr Raguram: Poems are like flowers, stemming from the heart and blossoming in delicate petals of words. We all use words, we all want to communicate and poetry does it seamlessly. It is a very powerful art form. In the words of William Wordsworth “poetry is the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge.” Expanding on this aspect, Ursula Le Guin commented, “Science describes accurately from outside, poetry describes accurately from inside. Science explicates, poetry implicates. Both celebrate what they describe. We need the languages of both science and poetry to save us from merely stockpiling endless ‘information’ that fails to inform our ignorance or our irresponsibility.”
Le Guin’s poems offer glimpses of her deep and abiding love of the natural world; ”I guess I’m trying to subjectify the universe, because look where objectifying it has gotten us. One way to stop seeing trees, or river, or hills, only as ‘natural resources,’ is to class them as fellow beings,as kinfolk.”
In this poem titled, ‘Kinship’, she explores the primordial ties that connect all life forms.
Very slowly burning, the big forest tree
stands in the slight hollow of the snow
melted around it by the mild, long
heat of its being and its will to be
root, trunk, branch, leaf, and know
earth dark, sun light, wind touch, bird song.
Rootless and restless and warmblooded, we
blaze in the flare that blinds us to that slow,
tall, fraternal fire of life as strong
now as in the seedling two centuries ago.

22/03/24, 8:45 pm - Nalini N R: Such a wonderful story with a message. Tiny drops of empathy and help can go a long way...March 20th my mother's birthday. She used to regularly feed the sparrows before her breakfast. It seems like history as even sparrows have entered photo frames in the city.

23/03/24, 6:50 am - Dr Raguram: Saigyo was a 12th century Japanese poet who became a Buddhist monk very early in his life. The most popular form of Japanese poetry is the haiku, the 17-syllable poem whicht reached the height of its development in the seventeenth century. But the haiku is derived from an older poetic form, the waka, which had been around for a thousand years before the haiku. The word waka means "Japanese poem," and it is a form so basic to Japanese literature that Japanese still study and write it today. It encompases five principal forms; tanka, chōk,a bussokusekika, sedoka, and katauta. The last three fell into disuse over time and wanka is now identified principally with the tanka. Saigyo was one of the greatest masters of tanka which is described as, “something which takes root in the soil of the heart and blossoms forth in a forest of words.”
Saigyo travelled all over Japan, living as a hermit in the mountains and writing poems which expressed his Buddhist principles and love of nature. Peering out through the window of his hut or sitting on a rock, he portrayed nature and the universe around him, as he saw them. For example, alone in his hut, he compares himself to the reclusive bird, warbler in a poem titled ‘The Bush Warbler Idling,’
“Seeping through the haze,
the voice
of the bush warbler—
few people passing,
mountain village in spring”.
Saigyo was deeply attracted to cherry blossoms and wrote many poems about it. In his final days, he moved to a hermitage in the mountains near Kyoto, which was surrounded by cherry blossom trees. He wished to die under the cherry blossom tree and wrote:
“let me die in spring
under the cherry blossoms
on that day
in the Second Month
when the moon is full”
Saigyo eventually accomplished his wish, and died peacefully in the year 1190 on 23rd March at the age of 73, beneath a blossoming cherry tree

24/03/24, 9:53 am - Dr Raguram: With the advent of online book collectives like the Amazon, scores of independent bookstores have pulled down their shutters. Yet there are a few that have survived this onslaught. The experience that envelops you when you step into such a brick and mortar bookstore is unsurpassable. As you walk through the aisles brimming with books, inhaling the inimitable smells emitted by them, the noise of the world outside slowly fades away and you are transported into the dreamy realm of the written word. Premier book shop in Bangalore was one such oasis.
I cannot resist visiting bookstores on my travels. The Strand at New York is a gargantuan cave with a huge collection of the old and new. The Green Apple in San Francisco comes a close second. Both have endless rows of books closely stacked together and one can spend hours getting lost amongst them! By comparison, the City Lights bookstore in the heart of North Beach, San Francisco is tiny. Named after the Charles Chaplin movie, it was founded by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti in 1953 and was the first all paperback bookstore in the United States. It specializes in publishing and selling avant garde literature which one may not find in any other bookstore. City Lights was the first to publish Allen Ginsberg’s ‘Howl’ and has a wide selection of Jack Kerouac’s works. One can pick a book, sit in the steps of the basement and spend hours browsing a book with no one looking over your shoulders. Interestingly, when you step out of the store, you walk into Jack Kerouac alley whose walls come alive with colourful murals.
Ferlinghetti was also a poet and I thought of sharing one of his poems on his birthday which sounds so relevant now.
PITY THE NATION (After Khalil Gibran) 2007
Pity the nation whose people are sheep
And whose shepherds mislead them
Pity the nation whose leaders are liars
Whose sages are silenced
And whose bigots haunt the airwaves
Pity the nation that raises not its voice
Except to praise conquerors
And acclaim the bully as hero
And aims to rule the world
By force and by torture
Pity the nation that knows
No other language but its own
And no other culture but its own
Pity the nation whose breath is money
And sleeps the sleep of the too well fed
Pity the nation oh pity the people
who allow their rights to erode
and their freedoms to be washed away
My country, tears of thee
Sweet land of liberty!

26/03/24, 7:40 am - Dr Raguram: The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.
These lines of Robert Frost are firmly etched in the memory of most of us. Jawaharlal Nehru kept them by his bedside. They inspire us to take a ‘turn’ through enchanting, deep woods in our life and continue our quest with renewed vigour. Perhaps  it also indicates that our final destination can be one of eternal sleep, death. By embracing the unpredictability of our last breath, it urges us to savour every moment in the journey of our lives.
The notion of woods as ‘dark and deep’ alludes to the fact that our experiences in life can be touched by ‘darkness’. Robert Frost’s poems emerged from the dark, deep depression that engulfed him for most of his life. He lost both his parents early and had a difficult early childhood. Both his mother and wife suffered from depression. Only two of his children survived. His son died by suicide and his daughter was committed to psychiatric facility. 
Robert Frost gave expression to his sense of isolation, sorrow and despair in this poignant poem:
ACQUAINTED WITH THE NIGHT
“I have been one acquainted with the night.
I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.
I have outwalked the furthest city light.

I have looked down the saddest city lane.
I have passed by the watchman on his beat
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.

I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
When far away an interrupted cry
Came over houses from another street,

But not to call me back or say good-bye;
And further still at an unearthly height,
One luminary clock against the sky

Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right. 
I have been one acquainted with the night.”
Each of us may experience a touch of ‘darkness’ sometime in our lives. Only poets like Frost can alchemize those experiences into glittering verses.

27/03/24, 7:53 am - Dr Raguram: I haven’t read much Chinese poetry. Sheerly by chance, I came up with the work Ai Qing. He was a notable poet during the Mao Zedong era in China. He spent more than twenty years in a hard labour camp, emptying latrines as a punishment for criticizing the government and for his ‘wrong mental condition’. What was his crime? During the brief ''hundred flowers'' period, he had written four fables pleading the party to show more understanding and respect for writers. In one of them, titled ''The Gardener's Dream,'' he wrote about a gardener who cultivated only roses. One night he dreamt that scores of different flowers pleaded to be let into his garden. When he awoke, the gardener thought to himself , ''Because I have shown favouritism to one type of flower only, I have caused discontent among all the other types of flowers. I am becoming more and more convinced that my world is too narrow.''
Breaking with traditional forms of Chinese poetry, Ai Qing innovatively adapted free verse, writing with simple, clear lines that could be understood by all readers. His poems flow like a sparkling stream… like this one:
What kind of bird is that
In that forest 
Singing, singing, singing, 
As though it is calling for someone, 
As though it is recounting something,
It does not stop though it is raining, 
Even its voice is wet 
Ai Qing compares himself to a bird that reaches out to the listeners, undeterred by the rain, pouring out songs. These lines derive and are anchored in myriad tribulations that he underwent in his life, writing poems amidst adverse circumstances.
His poem ‘Trees’ which I have attached with this note, opens with the line, ‘one tree, another tree’, rather than two trees, emphasizing how separate they are. Yet, they are united by the earth through their roots. It is a beautiful way of stating that no matter how isolated we appear on the surface, we are linked to each other through our roots.

30/03/24, 7:12 am - Dr Raguram: Bipolar disorder is a difficult illness. Journeying across its varied emotional landscape can be a daunting task as one is caught up in eddies of unpredictable swings of mood that can vary across a spectrum. It starts pervading one's whole being and often a person becomes an amalgamation of wounds in various stages of healing.
Textbooks offer impassioned descriptions of the illness with signs and symptoms to detect and categorize. The lived experience of the illness lurks beyond the pages of academic tomes. It is a welcome augury that many have authored insightful books about their experiences of living through the illness. Sometimes poetry captures these embodied experiences with remarkable poignancy. The constant battle between extreme highs and lows is often depicted through vivid imagery in poems, conveying the intense emotions that come with the disorder and the overwhelming feeling of being out of control. Once, a patient of mine with bipolar illness brought a piece of paper in which she had penned a few lines about it.
IN MY LIFE
In my  life    
I ride
On the rainbow
Sometimes.
Colours 
Flow through
My veins.
Surging eddies
Of energy
Soon fade away.
Colours lurk behind
Dark clouds.
All that is left
Is inky blackness.
It draws me 
In a vicious swamp
Till my breath
Becomes a mist
And I lose myself
Trying to find
My way
Amidst the dark clouds
In search
Of a ray of light..
As we usher in another World Bipolar Day, it is imperative to lend an ear and listen deeply to the lived experiences of people afflicted by it.

01/04/24, 7:24 am - Dr Raguram: Beauty comes in all colours. Black can be even more beautiful. Often birds are besotted with colourful birds. But with its striking black plumage and bright orange-yellow bill, the blackbird is an unmistakably bewitching bird today. I first saw it in the forests of BR Hills and it was a fascinating experience to hear its fluting, musical call too.
Blackbirds have been around for long. It has played a significant role in folklore and mythology in many cultures. There is a lovely folktale from Zambia, which has also been translated into an award winning childrens’ book..
Long ago, in the forests of Zambia, the blackbird was voted as the most beautiful bird,ever. The other birds, who were coloured red, yellow, blue, and green, were so enamoured with the blackbird’s colour that they begged it to paint their feathers black so that they could be beautiful too. The blackbird warned them "Colour on the outside is not what's on the inside. You don't act like me. You don't eat like me. You don't get down in the groove and move your feet like me." The other birds were insistent that they be painted black so that they can look beautiful too. Bowing to their demands the blackbird said "We'll see the difference a touch of black can make. Just remember, whatever I do, I'll be me and you'll be you”. Rather than painting them all black, it gave them a touch of black on their feathers, which is noticeable in birds to this day. Thus they embraced each other’s differences while maintaining their own distinctive individuality.
There is a lovely poem, ‘A Blackbird Singing’ by the talented Welsh poet RS Thomas,who was born on 29th March, 1913.
A BLACKBIRD SINGING
It seems wrong that out of this bird,
Black, bold, a suggestion of dark
Places about it, there yet should come
Such rich music, as though the notes'
Ore were changed to a rare metal
At one touch of that bright bill.

You have heard it often, alone at your desk
In a green April, your mind drawn
Away from its work by sweet disturbance
Of the mild evening outside your room.

A slow singer, but loading each phrase
With history's overtones, love, joy
And grief learned by his dark tribe
In other orchards and passed on
Instinctively as they are now,
But fresh always with new tears.
The poet was perhaps using the blackbird as a metaphor of black Africans.In spite of various travails endured by them, they keep their memories afresh through their music, imbued with a tinge of tears.

01/04/24, 10:48 pm - Nalini N R: Just like black bird there are so many wonderful talented singers from Africa.. The photograph catches the colours so well. With a tinge of blue and a coloured beak...

02/04/24, 7:47 am - Dr Raguram: I have an abiding interest in temple architecture and have been photographing and documenting ancient sculptures and mural paintings. There is something distinctive about sculptures that adorn Hindu temples. I was searching for a befitting description of these aesthetic creations and found it in the words of Octavio Paz, “Gothic architecture is the music turned to stone; one could say that Hindu architecture is sculpted dance.” No one could have said it better. Though steeped in history, these sculptures come alive (in spite of years of neglect and deterioration) and cast a lingering spell on the viewer. A notable example is the depiction of 108 Karanas  from the Natya Shastra of Bharata Muni which adorn the passages of all the four gopurams in Chidambaram..
Ocatavio Paz, poet, Nobel laureate and diplomat, spent several years in India and wrote a small, engaging book, ‘In Light of India’, reflecting on the history and ethos of the nation. Observing the sculptures of Elephanta Caves, he wrote, “I entered a world made of shadows and sudden brightness. The play of the light, the vastness of the space and its irregular form, the figures carved on the walls: all of it gave the place a sacred character, sacred in the deepest meaning of the word.”
In addition, Paz explored themes of identity, cultural heritage, and the complexities of India in this book. It is an insightful account, weaving together the intricate layers of its cultural tapestry and the impact they have on shaping individual identities and the collective consciousness of the nation. His observation was quite prescient, “We are witnessing now, at the end of the century, the resurrection of ethnic and psychic passions, beliefs, ideas, and realities that seemed to have been long buried. The return of religious passion and nationalist fervour hides an ambiguous meaning: Is it the return of ghosts and demons that reason had exorcised, or is it the revelation of profound truths and realities that had been ignored by our proud intellectual constructs?” 
Paz was an outstanding poet (more of it later!) and a glimpse of it in this short poem about the hummingbird which almost sounds like a Haiku.
Stillness
not on the branch
in the air
Not in the air
in the moment

06/04/24, 7:45 am - Dr Raguram: Once when I was birding in the Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary, I noticed this bird landing on a delicate, frail branch of a tree. The branch was swaying in  the early morning breeze. Suddenly there was a gust of wind and I wondered whether the brittle branch would break. At that moment, the bird took off, finding strength in its wings. 
As I watched, I kept wondering whether it was akin to a phase in the journey of recovery of patients with psychiatric illnesses. Recovery from ‘major’ psychiatric illnesses can be a challenging plight. Often, it  is a daunting task as the patient travels along the uneven, unsettling social landscape,negotiating demands, expectations and most importantly social stigma. It is almost a Sisyphean task. 
My MD thesis was on First Rank Symptoms of Schneider and since I worked in the same unit for over three decades, I was in a position to follow up many of the patients and  be a participatory witness in their journey. Contrary to the often touted ‘favourable’ recovery of schizophrenia in ‘developing’ countries like India, I have rarely seen a complete recovery in most of them. It is not the ‘psychotic’ symptoms that impair their recovery, but a host of emotional turmoils that are embedded in unsettling ‘real’ social contexts. Since the illness starts during the early adult period in their lives, which disrupts their academic and vocational pursuits, finding employment can be a difficult issue. It is also an unenviable task to manage their sexual strivings, which largely remains unaddressed by professionals. They can negotiate these demands to some extent, if there are safe, nurturing, supportive, immediate relationships. In the midst of it all, as their therapist, I strive to kindle and sustain hope in them to unravel their innate strength to cope with these formidable situations. In the words of Victor Hugo,
Be like the bird
Who, pausing in her flight
Awhile on boughs too slight
Feels them give way
Beneath her and yet sings,
Knowing that she hath wings.

Any deviance from normalcy is suffering for the patients as well as for the family. There is absolutely no tolerance. I think you remember Keshav Bharadwaj. He completed his Ph. D. And working for Infosys. Reinforcing their strengths matters so much in their difficult journey.

08/04/24, 7:55 am - Dr Raguram: Yet another solar eclipse…this time a total one is visible along a narrow track stretching from Texas to Maine in the USA and crowds of people are flocking to watch this celestial event. Unfortunately I will miss it this time. The first time I had a glimpse of it was in 1980. Few of us from NIMHANS who were keen not to miss the event, hopped onto a bus and travelled to Karwar as it was touted to afford the best view. We positioned ourselves on a small hillock overlooking the sea. There was lots of activity on the beach below with children and adults enjoying a stroll in the evening. The sea gulls were squawking noisily and merrily. A few had brought special glasses to view it. I was merely watching the light passing through tree leaves. To my fascination, the eclipse was projected onto the ground as the light passed through gaps in the leaves and I was  able to track the progress of the eclipse. As the eclipse advanced, the activity on the beach faded away and the gulls were suddenly quiet. Without a prelude, the sun disappeared totally, a black disc covering it like a lens cap. There was an eerie silence and the entire landscape was bathed in surreal colours. Slowly light peeped through like a thin golden ring around the sun. Though it lasted for just a few minutes, it was an enthralling experience during which I felt an intense sense of connectivity to another realm, a vast uncharted universe. In that brief moment when the all life- giving sun disappeared behind a black veil and re-emerged, it was a reminder that all things have an end and a new beginning. Navigating through life's valleys, we may experience a phase of darkness, till the ray of light illuminates and rejuvenates us. Embracing the inevitable cycle of darkness and light provides us an opportunity to reflect and expand our awareness towards a more meaningful existence.
Amidst one of the most tumultuous periods in his life, Mahatma Gandhi wrote, "In the midst of darkness, light persists.”

It is believed that Lord Brahma created the world on this day. According to a mythological story, a demon named Somakasura stole the Vedas from Lord Brahma. Somakasura later hid the Vedas in the sea. When Lord Vishnu came to know of this situation, he took the Avatar of a fish, the Matsya Avatar, to fight Somakasura under the sea. Lord Vishnu killed Somakasura and returned the Vedas to Brahma. After receiving the Vedas back, Lord Brahma started creating the world on this day. Ugadi is perhaps the only festival that exalts Lord Brahma.
There is an extraordinarily beautiful tall,long limbed, Brahma sculpture in the Brahmpureeswarar temple near Thanjavur, which is one of earliest Chola temples, constructed under the joint reign of Aditya-I and Parantaka-I Chola. According to ancient temple iconometry, sculptures are carved on the basis of the Tala system. Each Tala is equal to 12 Angulas.This particular sculpture of Brahma has been carved according to the Dasa (ten)tala system. On either side of Brahma are two Rishis writing down the Vedas chanted by him, on palm leafs. Curiously, in the midst of the makara torana on top was a small figure of Aalilai Kannan!
Dr Raguram
09/04/24, 8:18 am - Dr Raguram: If you scroll up in the photo you will see a depiction of Aalilai Kannan. I was totally surprised to see it! This is an iconic represenation of infant Krishna on a banyan leaf. The story behind this is described in detail in Bhagavata Purana. One day Sage Markendeya say a beautiful sight of an infant sleeping on a banyan leaf. It was infant Krishna. He was drawn inside the baby and witnessed the celestial sight of the entire universe. Thirumangai Azhwar described it in 4000 Divyaprabandam: நிலவொடு வெயில் நிலவு இரு சுடரும்
உலகமும் உயிர்களும் உண்டு ஒருகால்
கலை தரு குழவியின் உருவினை ஆய்
அலை கடல் ஆல் இலை வளர்ந்தவனே
ஆண்டாய் உனைக் காண்பது ஓர் அருள் எனக்கு அருளுதியேல்
வேண்டேன் மனைவாழ்க்கையை-விண்ணகர் மேயவனே (
In the form of a baby, you swallowed the world, the sun , the moon & all the life-forms and slumbered on a banyan leaf. I no longer seek the fleeting pleasures of this mortal world. Lord of Vinnagaram, all I ask for is the honor of worshipping you!
09/04/24, 10:12 pm - Nalini N R: Very nice Sir.
09/04/24, 10:23 pm - Nalini N R: Such a elegant figure of Lord Brahma! Reminds me of the bala leela of Krishna who showed the entire universe in his mouth to Ma Yashoda. It is a very cute sculpture of baby Krishna!! And thank you for the blessings Sir. Wish you all the same.

12/04/24, 8:36 am - Dr Raguram: Waterfowl employ a variety of "feeding modes" to satisfy their daily energy needs. It is interesting to see the mallards feeding in shallow waters. They prefer water that is less than three feet deep, and which has plenty of aquatic vegetation to feed on. They forage by dabbling, dipping their heads and necks underwater to grab shallow plants, while their tails and feathers stay above the water. Mallards are considered the generalists of the waterfowl world and they forage on a wide variety of food, seeds, waste grain, vegetation, and just about anything they can swallow. This is helped to a large extent by its broad and relatively unspecialized bill. They are incredible survivors, and can adapt to a wide range of habitats.
In Ogden Nash’s words:
Behold the duck.
It does not cluck.
A cluck it lacks.
It quacks.
It is specially fond
Of a puddle or pond.
When it dines or sups,
It bottoms ups.

15/04/24, 7:02 am - Dr Raguram: I was in the eighth standard when I first heard about Guru Nanak. Our school had a moral education session on the last Saturday of every month.Students were called upon to speak on various religious/spiritual traditions which was  followed up by a talk by a leading figure from that background. I was given the opportunity twice: the first time to speak on the ‘Sermon on the mount’ and the second time on ‘Guru Nanak’. I went to the school library to read about him and was attracted by the three pillars of Sikhism he outlined;  Kirat Karni (honest living), Vand Chakna (sharing with others) and Naam Japna (focus on God). At that time I didn’t know much about God but honest living and the spirit of sharing and giving appealed to my young mind and left a lasting impact. Perhaps it also laid the foundation for my interest in serving the needy, in later part of my life.
I cannot claim to have read all his works and shabads but I am drawn to his message of 'Ik Onkar': "Ik Onkar, Satnam, Karta Purakh, Nirbhau, Nirvair, Akal Murat, Ajuni Sae Bham, Guru Prasad." There's only one God, his name is the only truth, he is the only creator, he is fearless, he is without hate, he is immortal, he is beyond birth and death, and only by his grace one can chant his name. 
“Ḏasė ḝisĝ ravi­ĝ parabẖ ėk. Ḏẖaran akĝs sabẖ meh parabẖ pėkẖ. Jal thal ban parbaṯ pĝṯĝl.” “He can be found in all the ten directions, on land, in water, in the forests and mountains”
Guru Nanak died when he was seventy. In accordance with the Sikh tradition, on the day of his death, as he was sinking the community gathered around Nanak. Those of Hindu background insisted they should cremate his body, while Muslims wanted to bury him as a great saint. Nanak said, “Place flowers on both sides of my body—flowers from the Hindus on the right side and flowers from the Muslims on the left. If tomorrow the flowers of the Hindus are still fresh let my body be burned, and if the flowers of the Muslims are still fresh, let it be buried.” He requested that those present to place a sheet over his head and body, and instructed everyone to leave him.The Sikh, Hindu and Muslim devotees returned the following morning on September 22, 1539 A.D. They carefully lifted and removed the sheet and they were astonished to discover that there was no trace of Guru Nanak Dev Ji's mortal body. Only fresh flowers remained and not a single bud had wilted of any of the blossoms which had been left by either Sikhs Hindus or Muslims, the night before.
ਸਭ ਮਹਿ ਰਵਿ ਰਹਿਆ ਪ੍ਰਭੁ ਏਕੈ ਪੇਖਿ ਪੇਖਿ ਨਾਨਕ ਬਿਗਸਾਈ 
The One God is pervading in all. Gazing upon Him, beholding Him, Nanak blossoms forth in happiness

16/04/24, 7:49 am - Dr Raguram: Nature has always been a great source of inspiration to artists, right from the times of petroglyphs. As one of the most inspiring muses known to man, it provides endless inspiration to artists and has become a central theme in many famous artists' artworks. Artists not only recreate the natural world but also create new ways of perceiving it. 
The theme of the World Art Day on 15th April this year is ‘A Garden of Expression. Claude Monet, arguably the most important painter of gardens in the history of art, organized his garden at Giverny as though it were a huge painting. Inspired by Japanese prints, he diverted the water from river Epte into the gardens and developed an extensive pond and planted lilies.  But fearing the effect the water lilies might have on their livestock, the farmers wrote to local officials to block his plans. Fortunately, Monet was able to obtain permission to proceed after facing lots of difficulties. He painted hundred of lilies and titled the series as 
The Nymphéas. The word nymphéa comes from the Greek word numphé, meaning nymph, which takes its name from the classical myth that attributes the birth of the flower to a nymph who was dying of love for Hercules. In fact, it is also a scientific term for a water lily. In all these paintings he focused solely on the surface of the pond, with its cluster of vegetation ﬂoating amid the lilies. Painted on the backdrop of World War 1, these tranquil paintings perhaps provided ”a refuge of peaceful mediation” in turbulent times. Much like the Starry Nights of Vincent van Gogh, these are the most iconic images of the impressionist era of paintings. 
I was privileged to see the recreation of Monet’ garden in the New York Botanical Garden,several years ago. It was like walking amidst the canvases of Monet. There was the iconic Japanese footbridge, an amazing range of flowers of myriad hues and a lovely pond with floating lilies. I was totally immersed in watching the reflection of light on the shimmering waters of the pond, studded with beautiful lilies. Mone’t paintings of the lilies came alive at that moment. 
If William Blake saw the world “in a grain of sand”, Monet viewed the water lilies as an extension of his life, “without the water the lilies cannot live, as I am without art.”

17/04/24, 7:39 am - Dr Raguram: When Lakshmana fell unconscious during the battle with Meghnad, Jambavan suggested that only a herb with healing powers, sanjeevini, can revive him. Hanuman immediately flew in search of the mountain where the herb was to be found. In spite of his best efforts he couldn’t identify the herb and uprooted the whole mountain and flew back.  
This particular episode from Ramayana teeming with exquisite details is depicted in this beautiful painting, which is part of the first illustrated version of Valmiki Ramayana. The project was commissioned by the great Mughal Akbar and text of the great epic was translated into Persian. Abdul Qadir Badaoni was deputed by the emperor as the chief translator in partnership with Naqib Khan under the direction of a learned Hindu scholar, Deva Misra. It involved  several layers of translation. Brahmins at the court first translated the verses from Sanskrit into Awadhi. Court translators then rendered their transliteration into Persian verse, and court painters added their interpretations of the various scenes.
It was profusely illustrated with a vivid and sophisticated colour palette blending Indo-Persian aesthetic principles adroitly. It contained one hundred and seventy-six miniatures within three hundred and sixty-five finely calligraphed folios. The imperial copy of the Ramayana is now in Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum in Jaipur. Several copies of the original were made, one especially for Akbar’s mother, Hamida Banu Begum. This copy is preserved at Doha’s Museum of Islamic Art. One of the sub imperial copies is at the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington,which is remarkably congruent to the imperial copy. This has been digitized and available for viewing. It is a lasting testimony of the religious tolerance and all-inclusive spiritual world view of  Akbar. He envisioned his initiatives such as translation of the Ramayana not merely as an aesthetic exercise, but also as an efficient tool for dissemination of knowledge and spirituality, promoting religious tolerance and harmony.

19/04/24, 7:52 am - Dr Raguram: Lord Byron, whose death anniversary is today, passionately espoused the cause of Greek independence. In his epic work Don Juan, which included the poem The Isles of Greece, he pleaded with the Greeks to remember their heritage and unite to fight for their freedom.
“Trust not for freedom to the Frank
They have a king who buys and sells;
In native swords and native ranks
The only hope of courage dwells”
On December 29, 1823 Byron sailed to join Prince Aléxandros Mavrokordátos, the leader of the rebel forces in western Greece, to join their struggle for freedom and also trained troops. He was staying in the town of Missolonghi where he died of fever on April 19, 1824. His last words were reportedly , “Come, come, no weakness. Let’s be a man to the last. Shall I sue for mercy? I must sleep now”. The body was shipped to England and was buried on 16th July 1824, at Hucknall Torkard.
When I re-read his poem, ‘Darkness’ today, I wondered whether he was prescient in holding up the mirror for us to the ecological impact of climate change. In 1816 Europe, amongst other places in the world, experienced a drastic climate shift that produced famine, riots and mass death because of a large disease outbreak. All these were as a result of the eruption of Mt. Tambora in Indonesia. As a result, 1816 was called ‘The Year without Summer’, as temperatures dropped so much that there were some local recording drops of 3-5 degrees Fahrenheit on average, as was the case in New England. Byron wrote the poem ‘Darkness’, in the aftermath of this catastrophic changes of weather and the long poem ends with these apocalyptic lines:
It is a long poem and ends with these words:
They slept on the abyss without a surge—
The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,
The moon, their mistress, had expir'd before;
The winds were wither'd in the stagnant air,
And the clouds perish'd; Darkness had no need
Of aid from them—She was the Universe.

22/04/24, 7:35 am - Dr Raguram: On this World Earth Day, let me share a letter written by Thich Nhah Hanh.
Dear Mother Earth,
Every time I step upon the Earth, I will train myself to see that I am walking on you, my Mother. Every time I place my feet on the Earth I have a chance to be in touch with you and with all your wonders. With every step I can touch the fact that you aren’t just beneath me, dear Mother, but you are also within me. Each mindful and gentle step can nourish me, heal me, and bring me into contact with myself and with you in the present moment.
Walking in mindfulness I can express my love, respect, and care for you, our precious Earth. I will touch the truth that mind and body are not two separate entities. I will train myself to look deeply to see your true nature: you are my loving mother, a living being, a great being—an immense, beautiful, and precious wonder. You are not only matter, you are also mind, you are also consciousness. Just as the beautiful pine or tender grain of corn possess an innate sense of knowing, so, too, do you. Within you, dear Mother Earth, there are the elements of Earth, water, air and fire; and there is also time, space, and consciousness. Our nature is your nature, which is also the nature of the cosmos.
I want to walk gently, with steps of love and with great respect. I shall walk with my own body and mind united in oneness. I know I can walk in such a way that every step is a pleasure, every step is nourishing, and every step is healing—not only for my body and mind, but also for you, dear Mother Earth. You are the most beautiful planet in our entire solar system. I do not want to run away from you, dear Mother, nor to hurry. I know I can find happiness right here with you. I do not need to rush to find more conditions for happiness in the future. At every step I can take refuge in you. At every step I can enjoy your beauties, your delicate veil of atmosphere and the miracle of gravity. I can stop my thinking. I can walk relaxingly and effortlessly. Walking in this spirit I can experience awakening. I can awaken to the fact that I am alive, and that life is a precious miracle. I can awaken to the fact that I am never alone and can never die. You are always there within me and around me at every step, nourishing me, embracing me, and carrying me far into the future.
Dear Mother, you wish that we live with more awareness and gratitude, and we can do this by generating the energies of mindfulness, peace, stability, and compassion in our daily lives. Therefore I make the promise today to return your love and fulfil this wish by investing every step I take on you with love and tenderness. I am walking not merely on matter, but on spirit.

23/04/24, 7:43 am - Dr Raguram: On this World Book Day, let me pen a few words about a book that I read yesterday; ‘The Rumi Prescription: How an Ancient Mystic Poet Changed My Modern Manic Life’ by Melody Moezzi. Diagnosed to have Bipolar Disorder, she experienced severe bouts of depression, mania and had to be hospitalized on occasions. Medications helped her to balance her moods, but merely keeping the disorder in check did not satisfy her. She decided to channel her energy into writing and published her experiences of the illness in a powerful book, ‘Haldol and Hyacinths’.  Much like the hyacinth flower, which rarely grows perfectly straight, Moezzi urged the need to embrace the disorder and rely on the support from loved ones to keep afloat. The book was very well received. After many interviews in the media and countless promotional events, she felt utterly drained, not just physically and emotionally, but spiritually. In her words, “Consumed by an insatiable longing for more and bigger and better successes down the line, I lost track of the
present and grew so addicted to affirmation that I had no energy left for creation”.
It was at this stage that she rediscovered the timeless teachings of Rumi, with the help of her surgeon father. The book is organized in an innovative way with chapters titled as diagnosis and prescription, dealing with many of the tribulations the author underwent; wanting, isolation, haste, depression, distraction, anxiety, anger, fear, disappointment, and pride.  These are all inherent aspects of each of our lives and the author deftly uses Rumi’s poems as ‘prescriptions’ that we can imbibe. Let me outline some of these prescriptions:
On Haste and the need to Slow Down:
“You went out in search of gold far and wide
But all along you were gold on the inside”
On Depression:
“Where there are roses, thorns abound.
In the grand bazaar of life, joy without sorrow cannot be found”
On Anxiety:
“Forget your plans and embrace uncertainty.
Only then will you find stability”
On Disappointment
“Bread on your head and knee-deep in a river,
How are you so starved and withered?
You already own all the sustenance you seek.
If only you’d wake up and take a peek”
These verses of Rumi must be read in the context of the personal narratives of the author in the book. I strongly recommend it!
Let me end with this verse of Rumi:
“On the road to enlightenment, wise and mad are one.
In the way of Love, self and other are one.
For those who drink of the wine that connects souls,
In their religion, the Kaaba and the house of idols are one”

25/04/24, 7:41 am - Dr Raguram: In light of the recent deeply divisive, agonising  , electoral comments, it is perhaps time to read and reflect about Kabir and his writings. 
Kabir’s poetry urges us to rise above identity politics and to seek an essence that transcends notions of selfhood. In his works, he draws attention to multiple manifestations of this ‘essence’ and encourages us to celebrate them. 
“Chaahe Gita bachiye ya padhiye Quran
Tera mera pyaar hai har pustak ka gyan”
“It matters not if you read the Gita or the Quran
All holy texts preach love.”
More importantly, he emphasized how the process of  ‘othering’, in whatever way we view them as being ‘different’ from ‘our’ ways of knowing and being, keeps us locked up in firm, unempathetic stances. As mental health professionals we are deeply aware of the impact of ‘othering’ in stigmatising, marginalising and devaluing those who are considered and  responded to as being ‘different’.
Hence it is appropriate to recall Kabir’s words
“Bura dekhan main chala, bura na milya koye
Jo mann khoya aapna toh mujhsa buran na koye”
“I set out to find bad men, but couldn’t find any
When l looked within myself, l found there was no one worse than me.”
In Kabir's worldview, hatred has no place and one needs to look within oneself before directing fingers at others. 
In the words of Kabir, I reiterate:
“Aisi Baani boliye | Mann ka aapa khoye ||
Auran ko sheetal kare | Aaphu sheetal hoye ||”
“Let your speech be such that the ego of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ dissolves.
That the words you speak soothe everyone, and soothe you as well”
It hasn’t been easy to post this.

30/04/24, 7:11 am - Dr Raguram: Every time I spot a blackbuck I am amazed by its graceful elegance as it saunters across the grassland. They figure prominently in Hindu mythology. In Sanskrit texts, blackbucks are called “Krushna Mrug” (black deer). They are also considered the vehicles of Vayu (the wind god) and Chandra (the moon god).
Sangam poetry has vivid, wonderful descriptions of nature and animals. I was wondering whether there is a reference to the blackbuck. Finally I located one in verse 317 in Kurunthogai, which was penned by Madurai Kandarathnanar, In it, a close friend of a lady, consoles her that the man whom she loves deeply will return soon from his travels. 
புரி மட மரையான் கரு நரை நல் ஏறு
தீம் புளி நெல்லி மாந்தி, அயலது
தேம் பாய் மா மலர் நடுங்க வெய்து உயிர்த்து,
ஓங்கு மலைப் பைஞ் சுனை பருகும் நாடன்
நம்மை விட்டு அமையுமோ மற்றே-கைம்மிக
வட புல வாடைக்கு அழி மழைy 
தென் புலம் படரும் தண் பனி நாளே?
The context is that the man and the lady were deeply in love when the he parted away to gather wealth for their wedding. The lady languishes and loses her health in his absence. Observing her friend’s anxiety, the confidante says to her, “The fine, dark male with white patches, mate of the alluring and innocent female black buck, eats the sweet and sour gooseberry, and then, making the nearby honey-dripping huge flowers shiver with its hot breath, it drinks from the fresh springs in the soaring mountains of the lord. How can he stay away from you, in those moist and cold days, when the excessively strong northern winds scatter the rain clouds, making them move south?”. With these words, the confidante assures the lady that the man would return before the commencement of the rainy season. 
What a wonderful expression to soothe and calm an anxious, aspiring, loving, heart!
”The blackbuck stops
Our eyes meet
Tranquil stillness”

01/05/24, 6:52 am - Dr Raguram: On this Labor Day let us acknowledge the incredible efforts of someone who toils tirelessly, the worker bee. It is the smallest amongst the three (queen, worker and drone) in the honey bee colony The characteristic feature of the worker bee is its prominent proboscis which helps in collecting nectar from the flowers.
The worker bee has a very busy schedule. Depending on her age, she has many different roles to perform in the hive. When she is young, she is  a nurse bee, feeding bee larvae. She also takes on  the job of processing incoming nectar, feeding the queen, as well as making and capping the honey. Older worker bees leave the hive to collect the necessary resources from which the colony survives. Collecting nectar and pollen can be a dangerous task, due to risks from predators and pesticides. Their search expeditions and forays can take them four to five miles from their hive. When they return, they play an important role in maintaining the temperature and ensuring adequate ventilation of the hive. 
The lifespan of the worker bee is short. The time comes when it has to decide whether the hive is better off without her. It then make one last flight and often she does not have enough energy left to fly back and dies  From the moment they’re born, the worker bees are actively involved in executing various tasks for the collective good of the hive, which they fulfil with remarkable dedication till their end.
With a brain the size of a sesame seed, the worker bee is a source of inspiration. The work they do is not confined to the hive. They play a crucial role through their efforts in pollination in sustaining the ecosystem and life on earth. What they take from the landscape, they give back generously. We, as humans with much larger brains, have a lot to learn from them!

02/05/24, 8:23 am - Dr Raguram: Sometimes by sheer chance, one discovers an interesting book. This time it was ‘In The Shade Of The Spring Leaves’,a biography of a Japanese author, Ichiyo Higuchi, containing nine stories and extracts from her diary. It was a revelation. 
After finishing the book, I discovered that Ichigo Higuchi was a very important writer of the Meiji period and Japan’s first modern female writer. She was born in 1872 and died in 1896 at the tender age of 24. Born into a peasant family, her mother was not keen for her to be educated.  Finally at the age of 14 she was allowed to attend poetry school as a concession. That marked the beginning of an illustrious literary career. Higuchi picked the pen name “Ichiyō”, meaning “one leaf,” which has a deeper references to a specific form of Zen meditation. In her short life, wrote four thousand classical poems, many short stories, and kept a detailed, 60-volume diary. In one of the entries in the diary, quoted in the book, she writes;
“The rain stopped, green and fresh new leaves rise above the eaves. Pointless it is to wait for someone in my quiet house. I hear the voice of the vendor. And delve into reading a collection of Tang poems.”
Her stories are replete with lyrical passages like this one from‘Snowy Day’, “ Silver sprinkles the earth. Softly, snowflakes fall like dancing butterflies; wings flutter, but there is no sound.  Six-petalled crystals come to rest on withered trees, spring’s first flowering”.
Ichiyo Higuchi took me on a compelling journey and I travelled on the wings of her writings to discover an entirely new creative landscape.

03/05/24, 7:25 am - Dr Raguram: According to Greek mythology, orchids were made from the remains of a young man named Orchis. He was the son of a nymph and a satyr, and while attending a festival of the wine god Bacchus, he became drunk. He abused the priestess Bacchantes and was torn apart by the other guests at the party. When his sorrowful father asked Zeus to make him whole again, he refused but allowed flowers to grow from his remains. These were the first orchids. It should be noted that there are many variations of this story, but all do end with the creation of orchids from his remains.
Orchids exude undeniable charm and are symbolic of everything from life, love and happiness. As Eckhart Tolle, in his book A New Earth commented,”Humans would increasingly be drawn to and fascinated by them [orchids]....They provided inspiration to countless artists, poets, and mystics..more fleeting, more ethereal, and more delicate, they are like messengers from another realm, like a bridge between the world of physical forms and the formless."
I am enamoured of the ephemeral beauty of the orchids and when I looked closely at the heart of this moth orchid,

06/05/24, 8:43 am - Dr Raguram: Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote a memorable poem, ‘Hamatreya’ in 1847. It is based on a passage of the Vishnu Purana. The title of the poem is a shortened form of “Hail Maitraya”. Here, the poet records what the sage named Parashara taught his disciple Maitreya in response to the disciple’s query regarding the real worth of earthly possessions. Emerson guides us to be aware of the futility of our boasting and pride and points towards an awareness of earth’s living relationship to each one of us.  According to him, earth laughs at the boastful attitude of people who feel that they possess her. None can possess her and ultimately all of us are possessed by her. 
The flower in the image I’ve posted today is called by various names; Shiv Kamal,  Kailaspati and Nagalingam. Imbued with cultural and religious significance, it has petals resembling the hood of a Naga or serpent around its stamen which is considered as Shiva Linga. The tree, often referred to as cannonball tree has important medicinal properties. 
In my growing years there was a huge nagalinga tree in front of our house. Every morning, hundreds of flowers would be strewn all over the ground and there would be a contest amongst the children as to who could pick up the most. We spent many hours playing cricket under its vast canopy and when the ball went near its trunk, we would retrieve it with some trepidation as we were told that snakes might be lurking around the tree. 
One fine day, the owners of the property decided to cut it down to build new housing. All of us watched with dismay as the magnificent tree fell on the ground. We lost our much loved companion as also the birds and the squirrels, who lost a sturdy, reliable place to nest and rest. In the ensuing years the owners too had to undergo various shades of tribulations.
For me personally it was a kind of grief and an unsettling reminder of our disconnect from the non-human world, which has only gotten worse over the years.
Perhaps it’s time to read and reconnect with these timeless lines of ‘Hamatreya’.
“Where are these men? Asleep beneath their grounds:
And strangers, fond as they, their furrows plough.
Earth laughs in flowers, to see her boastful boy”.

07/05/24, 7:38 am - Dr Raguram: I became aware of the teachings of Rennyo on reading the book “Rennyo:The Second Founder of Shin Buddhism”. Various Buddhist sects celebrate and follow Buddha’s teachings through different practices, rituals, with emphasis  on different aspects of his teachings. While other schools of Buddhism seek to “attain” or “realize” enlightenment, the Shin Buddhist path focuses on simply listening and opening one’s heart to receiving it. “The pursuit of enlightenment can become something like chasing after a mirage in the desert: You think you have arrived, only to find it disappear “. Shin Buddhism emphasizes that one doesn’t have to become a monk or sit for hours in meditation and can experience this in everyday life through tuning the ears and the heart to listen to life unfolding around oneself.
Rennyo wrote 85 letters to convey his teachings. Let me draw attention to two excepts from it which made an impact on me. The first one is”White Ashes” in which he urges us to reflect on life’s impermanence:
“The people we leave behind and the people who go before us, are more numerous than dewdrops that rest briefly on leaves and branches. Hence, I may have a radiant face in the morning, but in the evening, become no more than white ashes.”
In the second one on awareness, he comments:
“As the sun shines upon the earth, awakening into growth the seeds that lie dormant in the soil, may the Light of Wisdom shine into our minds and truly awaken us to our ignorance and by this insight stir us to strive for a life of deeper understanding and enlightenment.”
An observation much in tune with that of Sri Ramana Maharishi, “Your own Self-Realization is the greatest service you can render the world”.

Time and again great people have stressed on this. It requires constant reminder every other moment and that really helps to change the perspective towards life and aim towards the goal of self realization.

10/05/24, 8:51 am - Dr Raguram: On Kaifi Azmi’s death anniversary, let us remember him through his famous poem ‘Doosra Banwas’. The poem is an poignant depiction of emotions Lord Ram would have experienced had he visited Ayodhya after 1992. It  expresses how grieved Ram was on his return from exile to witness the communal animosity and the divisive politics being played out in his name. After witnessing it, he opts for a second exile.
THE SECOND EXILE
That evening when Lord Ram returned to his home
He remembered the jungles where he had spent his years of exile
When he must have seen the dance of madness that December 6
It must have crossed his mind
From where have so many demented ones landed on my home
Wherever he had stepped and his footprints had shone
The river waters where thousands of stars of love meandered
Instead now took turns of violence and hatred
What is their religion, what is their caste, who knows?
Had the house not burnt, who would have known the faces
Of those who came to burn my house
Your sword, my friend, is vegetarian.
You threw towards Babar all the stones
It is my head’s fault that, instead, it bleeds
Lord Ram had not even washed his feet in the Saryu waters
When he saw deep blots of blood.
Getting up without washing his feet in the waters
Lord Ram left the precincts of his own residence, bemoaning,
The state of my own capital city no longer suits me
This December 6, I have been condemned to a second exile

11/05/24, 7:18 am - Dr Raguram: While birding in Seychelles last year, I noticed a fairly large sized bird hidden amongst the tree tops. From a distance, it looked like a dove. However, on close observation, it looked distinctive with a beautiful blend of browns, purplish-reds, and blueish-grays, with a brown eye with a red circle around it. At the end of the day, I checked my observations online and found out that it is referred to as Malagasy turtle dove. 
There are only six doves that bear the name “Turtle Dove”. They belong to two groups, the Nesoenas and the Streptopelia. The Malagasy Turtle Dove (Nesoenas picturata) is the only one in the Nesoenas. Its closest relative is the Pink Pigeon and together they form a lineage apart from both the typical pigeons and the other turtle doves.
Madagascar turtle doves produce a liquid called "crop milk" in their upper digestive tract that they regurgitate and feed to their young. While it is called milk, it does not contain lactose and is a blend of water, protein, fat, minerals and amino acids. I was told by the locals that it is quite adept in stealing copras that are left in the open to dry!
Often in the processe of glimpsing something anew, nature unveils itself and enthralls you!

16/05/24, 7:19 am - Dr Raguram: A few years ago I read a very perceptive story about ageing and declining memory,”In Sight of the Lake”, by Alice Munro, who passed away yesterday.. It is a non-linear story that goes back and forth about an old, widowed woman. She decides to visit a gerontologist to get help for her memory loss and drives to the village only to find that the doctor is not there. More distressingly, it’s the doctor’s day off. She also realizes that she has forgotten the piece of paper with the directions and has got the dates.wrong. She wanders around the town and finds out that the doctor works in a nursing home nearby. When she reaches the place, she feels trapped inside. She is now aware that it's the place she has already been in. She narrates her experience of being lost in search of the doctor to the nursing attendant. The story ends with the attendant’s response, “That’s the same thing you tell me every time.”
Growing old is like a trip through a difficult, unfamiliar country and there have been many accounts of it in the literature. What is particularly poignant about this short story is that it was written in a period of time when the author herself was in the throes of early dementia. It was among other reasons why she couldn’t travel to accept the Nobel prize in person. 
Works of art often emerge from a slew of experiences, sometimes deeply personal. In the process, the tenuous border between the artist and the character she essays, becomes blurred. Deeply enmeshed internal stories of the author get transformed as powerful, poignant narratives in the literary landscape. It is not an easy task. In Murakami’s words, “Sometimes I can't even remember what I was trying to say in the first place. It's like my body's split in two and one of me is chasing the other me around a big pillar. We're running circles around it. The other me has the right words, but I can never catch her.” 
Alice Munro seems to have bridged this gap with ease in this harrowing story about declining memory and loss of self hood.

17/05/24, 6:13 am - Dr Raguram: Endangered Species Day on the third Friday of May was created to increase awareness as to how fragile the existence of some animals,plants and insects is. According to the IUCN, at least 40% of animals, insects and plants are at risk of extinction across the world. On this day, let me draw attention to an endangered bird, the Steppe Eagle..
Little Rann of Kutch is a magical landscape. Ahalya and myself spent several days exploring and savouring the immense biodiversity of the region in the company of Mr Jugal Kishor Tiwari, famed ornithologist and ecologist. One of our first sightings was the Steppe Eagle. Perched on a sandy mound, it was surveying the vast territory for suitable prey. It looked stunning with its rich brown plumage. Steppe eagles migrate to India from their breeding grounds in Central Asia and Eastern Europe. They play an important role in nature by helping to control populations of prey animals and maintain a balance in the ecosystems. It is categorized as an endangered species, because of major declines in their populations over the past few decades. Reasons for this are varied; environmental changes, overhunting by predators, poaching, the changing or destruction of habits by humans, or natural disasters, to name a few.
There’s a tremendous need for a worldwide conservation effort to prevent such species from being lost forever. No species has ever had such wholesale control over everything on earth, living or dead, as we now have. It is our responsibility to initiate measures at conserving species that are endangered. 
In the words of EO Wilson, “Look closely at nature. Every species is a masterpiece, exquisitely adapted to the particular environment in which it has survived. Who are we to destroy or even diminish biodiversity?”

18/05/24, 7:20 am - Dr Raguram: When I first laid hands on Edward Fitzerald’s translation of Omar Khayyam’s ‘Rubaiyat’ I was mesmerised by its haunting beauty. In just four lines, the poems explored themes of love, fate, mortality, and the transient nature of life with elegance and simplicity. The verses offered a contemplative perspective on life, urging us to seize the moment and find joy in the face of life’s uncertainties. He alludes to the temporality of life in these deeply reflective words:
“I saw the potter in the market yesterday 
Pounding and pounding upon a piece of clay 
“Behold,” said the clay to the potter 
Treat me gently for once like you, now I am clay.”
The tapestry of our lives is woven with diverse threads, some of them bleak and dark. Khayyam urges us to dance in the present and relish the beauty of each moment, embracing the ephemeral lives we lead, wholeheartedly and with joy. 
“Since neither truth nor certitude is at hand 
Do not waste your life in doubt for a fairyland 
O let us not refuse the goblet of wine 
For, sober or drunken, in ignorance we stand”.
Khayyam’s verses are like delicate blossoms that bloom with timeless beauty and endless charm. It is hard to resist their irresistible allure.
“Come, fill the Cup, and in the Fire of Spring
The Winter Garment of Repentance fling:
The Bird of Time has but a little time to flutter
And the bird is on the wing”.
It is a reminder to seize the moment, while we still have the wings and to soar!
(Omar Khayyam was born on this day, 18th May, in Nishapur, northern Persia)

19/05/24, 6:48 am - Dr Raguram: It is an enchanting experience to watch birds. A new window opens up to unravel alluring secrets from another world. In that absorbing moment I become one with them.
Let me recollect an interesting poem about birding from Ogden Nash whose death anniversary is today.
“Bird watchers top my honours list.
I aimed to be one, but I missed.
Since I'm both myopic and astigmatic,
My aim turned out to be erratic, 
And I, bespectacled and binocular,
Exposed myself to comment jocular.
We don't need too much birdlore, do we, 
To tell a flamingo from a towhee:
Yet I cannot, and never will,
Unless the silly birds stand still.
And there's no enlightenment in a tour 
Of ornithological literature.
Is yon strange creature a common chickadee,
Or a migrant alouette from Picardy?
You can rush to consult your Nature guide
And inspect the gallery inside,
But a bird in the open never looks
Like its picture in the birdie books-
Or if it once did, it has changed its plumage,
And plunges you back into ignorant gloomage.
That is why I sit here growing old by inches,
Watching a clock instead of finches,
But I sometimes visualize in my gin
The Audubon that I audubin”.

20/05/24, 6:50 pm - Dr Raguram: Bees have been around for long. In Ancient Egypt, tears of the Sun God Ra turned into bees upon touching the ground.and in Ancient Greece, bee was a cult symbol for  Artemis, goddess of wild nature. In Indian mythology, Honeybees form the string of  Kama’s bowmade of sugarcane. In the words of the poet Kalidasa, Kama, “bears the bow of Love; and on that bow, the lustrous string is made of bees….Weaves a string of Bees with deft invention, To speed the missile when the bow is bent.”
It is believed that Brahma resides as a bee of Vishnu’s navel-lotus, humming vedic texts. There is also a mention about a goddess, Brahmari in Srimad Devi Bhagavatam;book 10, chapter 13.  Bhramari, who slayed the demon Arunasura, is considered as the goddess of bees. Lakshmi tantra (9,41-43), also mentions her, “During the sixtieth era there will be one demon, called Aruṇa who will do much harm to men and sages. Then I shall appear in bee-form incorporating innumerable bees, and I shall slay the mighty demon and rescue the three worlds. From then on people will praise me forever and address me as Bhrāmarī.” Iconographically she is portrayed with scores of bees emanating from her hands. Brahmari is worshipped on the eighth night of the Navarathri festival. There is a temple for her in Kasauni. It is said that Adi Guru Shankaracharya spent sometime in the temple, which is situated at the top of a mount enclosed by a fort. Bhramari Pranayama is a yogic technique that consists of concentrating on the sound emulating a bee along with breath control. The vibration of sound produced is said  to enhance the level of consciousness. So the next time you hear the hum of a bee, do not panic!

23/05/24, 7:13 am - Dr Raguram: Buddha’s followers never officially celebrated his birthday, till it was formalized in May 1950, at the first conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists in Colombo, Sri Lanka. It was agreed upon that the day of the full moon in May would be auspicious, due to Buddha attaining nirvana on a full moon day. 
The natural world was ubiquitous in the Buddha’s life and teachings. Forests and woodland parks were the most common setting where people met the Buddha and listened to his teachings. Nature provided the backdrop and the context for his teachings and the natural settings played an important role in his awakening and his teachings. The important connection he saw between nature and the practices he taught is encapsulated in some of his utterances like this one;
“If we could see the miracle of a single flower clearly our whole life would change. ” 
On this Buddha Purima day, it would be wonderful to become aware that sources of immense awareness is all around us in our everyday lives…let us pause and reflect.

02/06/24, 8:56 am - Dr Raguram: All of us are curious about the outcome of the elections and are besieged with countless exit polls which vary in their calculations which are at best astrological. Talking of curiosity, no other feathered creature has aroused interest owing to its uncanny nature, like the owl, in literature, across ages. They are perhaps the most commonly mentioned birds in literature. Watching the endless discussions about electoral trends, I am reminded of a tale from Aesop Fables, ‘The Owl and the Birds’. It narrates how the ordinary birds ignore the warnings of the wise owl. Later when they are proved wrong and the owl is proved to have been right, they turn to it for pearls of wisdom, but the owl is now silent and ‘no longer gives them advice, but in solitude laments their past folly’.
There is another interesting story in the eighteenth century English author John Gay’s, ‘Fifty-one Fables in Verse’.  In one of them a grumpy owl laments that he is not being paid sufficient attention. Overhearing it, a sparrow comments that the birds have now learned that looks can be misleading and that just because the owls happen to appear wise and venerable does not necessarily mean that they are so. It goes on to say that if the owl concentrates on what it is good at, namely catching mice, the farmers will applaud and respect its work, rather than looking for false respect for its looks. 
A group of owls is called a ‘parliament’. It has its origins in the 1950s children's classic ‘The Chronicles of Narnia’ by CS Lewis. Lewis adopted the title of the Chaucer’s allegorical poem "The Parliament of Fowls to describe a council of owls who meet at night to discuss the affairs of Narnia. 
Will we have wise owls in the new parliament or like the one in ‘Winnie the Pooh’, where the character named Owl presents himself as wise and knowledgeable but is really a scatterbrain who even spells his own name incorrectly as “Wol”

06/06/24, 7:55 am - Dr Raguram: Shifting the focus from the stirrings in the political environment (yesterday was the World Environment Day), let me draw attention to the ‘real’ environment that surrounds each one of us. Though all parties pay lip service to the importance of conservation and protection of the environment, the sad fact is that elections are not won on the basis of this important issue. This is all the more unsettling since there has been a steady degradation and depletion of forest cover over the past few years in our country.
Let me step back from the swirling eddies of politics and take recourse to Thich Nhat Hanh. His last book before his death at 95 was on the environment. It was published in 2021 as ‘Zen and the Art of Saving the Planet’. In it, he emphasizes that change is possible only if there is a recognition that people and planet are ultimately one and the same; "You carry Mother Earth within you, she is not outside of you…So to breathe in and be aware of your body and look deeply into it and realise you are the Earth and your consciousness is also the consciousness of the earth”. He points out that with this insight about the state of inter-being, “it is possible to have real communication with the Earth, which is the highest form of prayer”.

07/06/24, 10:34 am - Dr Raguram: Sometimes, a small, unobserved detail in a painting can be an object of intense scrutiny. Take for instance the painting, ‘The Sorcerer of Hiva Oa’, by Paul Gaugin. It was painted by him during his sojourn in 1902 on the small Pacific island of Hiva Oa in French Polynesia's Marquesas. The main focus in the painting is that of the sorcerer who is adorned with a dramatic red cape. If one looks at the bottom right, there is a dog holding a bird in its jaws. Over the years, the identity of this bird has been an object of intense curiosity and speculation. One suggestion was that it could be a large flightless New Zealand bird, ‘Takahe’. The problem with this surmise is that Hiva Oa is far away from New Zealand and couldn’t have travelled that far. Moreover, it was pointed out the Takahe’s head is dark blue, whereas in the painting the head of the bird is green. Much later, in 1937 Norwegian voyager Thor Heyerdahl spotted a strange bird while visiting Hiva Oa.  He saw a hen-sized flightless bird scurrying rapidly between tall ferns and was told by the islanders that this was the Koao. Could it be the now extinct Marquesas Swamp Hen? Or was it the Takahe, one of the rarest birds native to New Zealand? Finally, in 1988, 600-year-old bones of a bird was found in Marquesas which was identical to the description of Koao, but unfortunately there was no way to find out the colouration, which could have solved the riddle!  
Artists are endowed with keen powers of observation. Did Gaugin notice the bird and painted it? It is interesting that a small detail from a painting by a great artist kindled an ornithological mystery, which remains unsolved till now!

15/06/24, 9:33 am - Dr Raguram: The stories of Jorge Luis Borges can be read in a matter of minutes, yet the impact upon the reader is profound. Take for instance the story, ‘The Book of Sand’: the three pages long story is a deeply engaging narrative about a mysterious book which appears to have an infinite number of pages. It was sold to him by a bookseller who bought it in India, from a low caste man. When the narrator opens the surprisingly heavy book, he finds the script to be unfamiliar, laid out in double columns, with page numbers. which do not run in any sequential order. It also contains clumsily drawn illustrations on some pages of the book. The narrator is unable to find either the first or last page of the book and as he browses through it, more and more pages appear. Overwhelmed by curiosity, he becomes obsessed with the book over time. He also notices that he can never find the same page twice in the book. He comes to view the book as ‘monstrous’, and wants to destroy it, but fears that if he tries to burn the book, it might result in an infinite fire whose flames would engulf the whole world. He feels that “the best place to hide a leaf is in a forest” and disposes of the book by taking it to the Argentine National Library and hiding it in one of the musty shelves in the library’s basement. 
The beauty of the story is that every time I read it, a new perspective emerges. Is the writer alluding to the hold of curiosity in human imagination or is it a meditation on the nature of infinity? Perhaps it refers to our deepest strivings to probe, understand, and make sense of the vast, unfathomable essence that is woven into the grand cosmic tapestry.
The infinite has always been of interest to people, mathematicians, physicists and philosophers. But very few can decode and render it in magical words like Borges!

16/06/24, 9:25 am - Dr Raguram: Gordon Parks, Sr. was a hugely talented polymath. He was a photographer, filmmaker, composer, writer, journalist, novelist and a poet. On Father’s Day I thought of sharing one of his beautiful poem ‘The Parting’, wherein the father prepares his son to find his own life path amid signposts signalling devious directions and roads "paved with roses and thorns." Success, the father concludes, will be determined by whether the son, in the autumn of his own life, can thankfully manage a smile. 
THE PARTING 
Two roads passed my father’s house,
paved with roses and thorns.
They went everywhere, with tolls
unfixed on unmarked distances,
paved with roses and thorns.
Papa said a few things when I was packed to go:
The feel of your feet will reconcile the differences in which road you take.
Signposts along the way will give devious directions.
It is your right to question, but don’t ignore them.
Each one is meant for something.
Summer grass underfoot will be kinder than weeds.
Yet during winter storms, it will be the taller stalks, leaning above the snow, that will catch your eye. And you will learn that all things are not the same.
You must select your friends with the same care I gave to selecting your mother.
Avoid things that die too easy, and get your soul ready to die well.
As you grow older, you will pray more and worry less.
Well, what I’ve told you might amount to everything, or maybe nothing.
Just be thankful if, in autumn, you can still manage a smile.

17/06/24, 7:31 am - Dr Raguram: The Norman Rockwell Museum is located in Stockbridge, Berkshire County amidst carefully tended, lush gardens overlooking the picturesque Housatonic River Valley. It is home to the largest collection of his original works. When I was looking today at some of the photographs I took of the displays in the collection, one particular canvas titled, ‘New in the neighbourhood’ stood out. It portrayed a family moving into a new locality. Five kids are portrayed in the painting and noticeably, there is a distance between the white kids who are looking at the two black children with some curiosity. If one looks closely, an adult is seen peering from behind the window curtain. The entire painting draws attention to issues in assimilation of people viewed as being ‘different’. 
In his 1903 book, ‘The Souls of Black Folk’, DuBois wrote about the social philosophy of ‘double consciousness’: “It is a sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity… two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals”.  During the period of segregation, African Americans essentially lived in segregated communities not by choice, but forced into these places by racial prejudice and led parallel lives. 
Sometime I wonder whether we are also slowly and steadily moving into such situation in India. A recent news that residents in a housing complex in Ahmedabad were preventing a person from a minority community from moving into her allotted unit raises concerns. Out of an unseen and ever-lingering fear and mistrust, people belonging to the minority community will gradually move into separate, demarcated areas. This will result in an unfortunate situation of ghettoization of both communities. Secularism and comradeship will soon vanish in these spaces.
“All good people agree,
And all good people say,
All nice people, like Us, are We
And everyone else is They:
But if you cross over the sea,
Instead of over the way,
You may end by (think of it!) looking on We
As only a sort of They!”

20/06/24, 9:04 am - Dr Raguram: In a world bristling with distractions the simple act of picking up a book, opens up doors of enlightenment, knowledge, and personal transformation. It is a catalyst for personal growth and self-discovery. The person who unveiled the power of the written word to uplift, educate, and empower was PN Panicker. 
Puthuvayil Narayana Panicker is known as the Father of the Library Movement in Kerala. The activities of the Kerala Grandhasala Sangham that he initiated triggered a popular cultural movement in Kerala which contributed to the universal literacy in the state in the 1990s. Panicker led the formation of Thiruvithaamkoor Granthasala Sangham (Travancore Library Association) in 1945 with 47 rural libraries. The slogan of the organization was 'Read and Grow '. Later on, with the formation of Kerala State in 1956, it became Kerala Granthasala Sangham (KGS). He travelled across Kerala proclaiming the value of reading. He succeeded in bringing some 6,000 libraries into this network. He founded the Kerala Association for Nonformal Education and Development (KANFED) in 1977. KANFED was instrumental in starting the Kerala State Literacy Mission, which led Kerala to its universal literacy movement. Kerala became the first state which achieved universal literacy. 
Panicker died on 19 June 1995, at the age of 86. His death anniversary, is observed in Kerala as Vayanadinam (Reading Day) since 1996. The Department of Education in Kerala also observes Vayana varam (Reading Week) for a week from June 19 to 25. In 2017, Govt of India declared June 19th as National Reading Day.

21/06/24, 11:27 am - Dr Raguram: Historically, both yoga and Indian classical dance traditions share Vedic roots in the ancient texts of Patanjali Yogasutra and Natyashastra, respectively. For both, the body is a temple and the dance/asana is one’s prayer. The emphasis on stilling the mind through concentration on the inner and outer bodies, moving the practitioner toward an experience of freedom. 
Natya yoga is the name given to a type of yoga that combines yoga and dance-like movements as a spiritual practice. It has similarities to Hatha yoga, but it has a different approach in that it also integrates elements of dance and mime, rather than static asanas. Quite a number of asanas of Hatha Yoga are in parallel with some of the 108 karanas of the Natyashastra. Karanas are basically yogic poses in rhythm. The karanas are dance counterparts of asanas and like the alignment of asanas, the karanas focus on the center line of the body in relation to gravity paying attention to the pathways of energies that flow through the body.
Thillai Nataraja Temple in Chidambaram is one of very few temples that have all 108 karanas from the Natya Shastra. They are depicted in the stone carvings on the passage walls in the gopurams of the temple.  Most of the dance poses in this temple resemble various yoga poses. The karanas arise from fundamental yogic postures. Many of the 108 karanas employ various yogic postures like Garudasana, Natarajasana etc. When yoga is used with stylistic expression it becomes an instrument to evoke Rasa.
The photograph depicts Lalāṭatilaka, which is 50th Karana, where the left leg is placed on the ground with the feet flat in and the knee bent. The right leg is lifted up and bent and the toes virtually touching the forehead. The hand is held in Anjali mudra and the face and the head are tilted back.

24/06/24, 11:49 am - Dr Raguram: Ambrose Bierce who was born on this day in 1842 is largely known as the author of the interesting, ‘The Devil’s Dictionary’. He also wrote several trenching stories about the harsh realities of war. Bierce was a Union soldier during the Civil War and he gave expression to his traumatic memories in his stories, in a collection titled, ‘Civil War Stories’. 
‘The Mocking Bird’, is particularly poignant short story from this collection. Private William Grayrock is posted on picket duty and on hearing the approach of someone he cannot see, he shoots blindly into the night and is certain he has hit a man in the darkness. He is lauded for protecting the regiment from intruders, but Grayrock is beset with guilt and goes in search and to his great dismay finds that he has shot his long last twin brother. Overcome with intense grief, he doesn’t return to the camp and wanders off.  
The story juxtaposes the harsh realities of war with memories fond family relationships. As he goes in search of the person he had shot, Grayrock dreams about his childhood friendship with his brother and their attachment to their most precious possession, a mockingbird. “Through all the golden days floated one unceasing sound-- the rich, thrilling melody of a mocking-bird in a cage by the cottage door. It pervaded and possessed all the spiritual intervals of the dream, like a musical benediction. The joyous bird was always in song; its infinitely various notes seemed to flow from its throat, effortless, in bubbles and rills at each heart-beat, like the waters of a pulsing spring”.  As “he was passing a thicket of laurel, a bird rose from the midst of it and perching on the branch of a tree above, poured from its joyous breast so inexhaustible floods of song as but one of all God's creatures can utter in His praise. There was little in that--it was only to open the bill and breathe; yet the man stopped as if struck --stopped and let fall his rifle, looked upward at the bird, covered his eyes with his hands and wept like a child”.  When he finally notices the dead body of his twin brother, “the shrilling bird upon the bough overhead stilled her song and, flushed with sunset's crimson glory, glided silently away through the solemn spaces of the wood”. 
The mocking bird is a crucial metaphor in this haunting story. The bird is reportedly quite caring when it comes to protecting its family from predators and sadly witnesses an avoidable tragedy involving two brothers whose memories are entwined with it. 
The story is also about the futility of war. The American Civil War created deep divisions between the North and South and also divided many families. Some family members fought for the Union, while others sided with the Confederacy. It ripped the country apart and in many of those deadly battles, brothers fought against their own brothers, at times killing each other. 
As François de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon, a French theologian, poet and writer, commented perceptively, “All wars are civil wars because all men are brothers... Each one owes infinitely more to the human race than to the particular country in which he was born.”
Traumatic memories of war linger on for long in the psyche of the individual and often remains unresolved. Ambrose Bierce’s death remains an unsolved mystery. Did he commit suicide, or pneumonia took a toll on him or was he killed by Mexican federal forces? In his last known communication, he wrote, “As to me, I leave here tomorrow for an unknown destination.”

25/06/24, 8:39 am - Dr Raguram: Judith Wright was a prolific Australian poet, critic and short-story writer, who published more than 50 books. She was also an uncompromising environmentalist and social activist campaigning for Aboriginal land rights. Late in life, she settled to a remote property near the heritage town of Braidwood, south of Canberra, where she wrote many of her nature poems. Judith was one of Australia’s most celebrated poets and one of the two to be considered for the Nobel prize. Her book ‘Birds’ was first published in 1962 and one of the poems is about the Magpie:
Along the road the magpies walk
with hands in pockets, left and right.
They tilt their heads, and stroll and talk.
In their well-fitted black and white.
They look like certain gentlemen
who seem most nonchalant and wise
until their meal is served – and then
what clashing beaks, what greedy eyes!
But not one man that I have heard
throws back his head in such a song
of grace and praise – no man nor bird.
Their greed is brief; their joy is long.
For each is born with such a throat
as thanks his God with every note.
When we were birding in Australia, we spotted the Australian Magpie on many occasions. When I read this poem I was struck as to how beautifully she has described the bird’s behaviour, especially in the first four lines. She then compares the bird to “certain gentlemen” who are greedy to just fulfil their need. Finally, she alludes to the magpies' remarkable singing abilities, which surpass even those of human beings. The poem ends with her thoughtful reflection that the magpie’s “greed is brief, their joy is long” and they “thank his God with every note.”
Judith died of heart attack in Canberra on June 26 at the age of 85. Her ashes were scattered around the mountain cemetery of Tamborine Mountain. Wright had owned a strip of rainforest nearby, which she donated to the state so it could be preserved as a national park.

25/06/24, 10:44 pm - Nalini N R: You are enlightening us with so many varieties of birds. What a creation and the poets are blessed with their ability to describe them and compare and contrast with humans. Greed is brief and joy is long which is the opposite for our man'kind'?

26/06/24, 9:28 am - Dr Raguram: As we were birding around the Stow Lake in Golden Gate Park few months ago, the unmissable melodious note of the Song Sparrow drew our attention. Thoreau described it as “Maids! Maids! Maids! hang up your teakettle-ettle-ettle.” Some others compared it the opening notes of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony! It was flitting through low branches, occasionally moving onto open ground in search of food, pumping its tail up. It was foraging on the ground kicking away debris by hopping forward while sweeping both feet quickly back along the ground, a move often described as ‘song sparrow samba’! Soon, it perched on a stump and started singing. 
Most of what we know about the song sparrow emerges from the work of one amateur ornithologist, Margaret Morse Nice. She shifted the focus away from collection, description of bird specimens and emphasized on close observation on bird behaviour in their natural setting. She observed and compiled a detailed study of the song sparrow in her own backyard. She marked each bird with a coloured band and managed to follow and study 336 individual birds in detail. And one of them, which she named 4M, remained in her study area for seven years. She described her technique as a “phenomenogical method.” Interestingly, it is through the phenomenological approach as mental health professionals, we explore and understand the lived experience of people in throes of psychological distress. Her study, which spanned eight years, detailed the daily activities and territorial behaviour of several generations of song sparrows.  Though she lacked a professional position and funding, she published 250 articles, five monographs and single-handedly initiated a new era in American ornithology. 
In the words of Margaret Morse, “the study of nature is a limitless field, the most fascinating adventure in the world.” There are plenty of birds like the song sparrow right in our backyards/environs and her work should inspire us that we can learn a lot about them through careful observation. 
With tongue in cheek, she observed, “I decided it would be better to be a bird. Birds are very busy at one period each year caring for babies, but this lasts only a few weeks with many of them, and then their babies are grown and gone. Best of all, they leave their houses forever and take to camping for the rest of the year. No wonder they are happy.”
(Margaret Morse Nice 6th December 1983 – 26th June 1974)

27/06/24, 9:13 am - Dr Raguram: Another bird that caught my attention down under, because of it gruesome ways of having food was the butcherbird. When it caught a prey, it hung it on a branch and scythed the meat away, just like a butcher. It kept any uneaten bits of food between the twigs in a tree and came back to eat the leftovers, later. Though aggressive in its behaviour, I was quite surprised to see the bird visit the kitchen window in a friend’s house regularly and savoring the cooked rice!
Many works of fiction have been woven around the butcher bird, often in the genre of fantasy and horror. It also figured in the poems of Charles Causley, the Cornish poet, who was profoundly influenced and impacted by the World War I. His father returned from the war as an invalid. As an only child, Causley spent his first seven years watching his father slowly die. He also witnessed the suffering shell-shocked soldiers who walked aimlessly around the town. These experiences found expression in his poems. In a poem titled “Recruiting Drive,” bristling with images of violence and deception, he uses the metaphor of the butcher bird as someone who lures young men to their deaths in battle.
RECRUITING DRIVE
“Under the willow
I heard the butcher-bird sing,
Come out you fine young fellow
From under your mother’s wing.
I’ll show you the magic garden
That hangs in the beamy air,
The way of the lynx and the angry Sphinx
And the fun of the freezing fair.
Lie down lie down with my daughter
Beneath the Arabian tree,
Gaze on your face in the water
Forget the scribbling sea.
Your pillow the nine bright shiners
Your bed the spilling sand,
But the terrible toy of my lily-white boy
Is the gun in his innocent hand.”

29/06/24, 12:02 pm - Dr Raguram: Antoine de Saint-Exupéry was born on this day in 1900. He was a precocious, talented child, who attached wings to his bicycle, to fulfil his dreams of becoming a pilot. He wrote only one children’s book, ‘The Little Prince’, in his lifetime and it is one of those rare gems. The strength of any great work of literature is that it can be read and reflected upon at many levels.  The book is both an engaging children’s fantasy and yet at the same time a philosophical fable on various aspects of life. 
For me personally, there are two important inspirational dimensions embedded in this timeless tale.
The first theme is about the power of enduring love. The Little Prince has many encounters, one of which is with a Rose. She is delicate, vulnerable, needs watering and protection. She has only four thorns to protect herself and Little Prince dutifully cares for her. But then he must move on. Accepting his departure, the Rose comments, “Well, I must endure the presence of a few caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies.” A message as important as in any great philosophical tome. The little prince then encounters the fox who tells him that love is when you care enough to tend to someone who needs care. 
The second theme is one of separation from a loved one, of loving someone with the inevitability of losing that friend. In a beautiful, poignant passage, the writer reflects, “Bit by bit… it comes over us that we shall never again hear the laughter of our friend, that this one garden is forever locked against us. And at that moment begins our true mourning, which, though it may not be rending, is yet a little bitter. For nothing, in truth, can replace that companion. Old friends cannot be created out of hand. Nothing can match the treasure of common memories, of trials endured together, of quarrels and reconciliations and generous emotions. It is idle, having planted an acorn in the morning, to expect that afternoon to sit in the shade of the oak. So life goes on. For years we plant the seed, we feel ourselves rich; and then come other years when time does its work and our plantation is made sparse and thin. One by one, our comrades slip away, deprive us of their shade.”
And I keep reflecting on these timeless words of the author, “What is essential is invisible to the eye.” It emphasizes the importance of looking beyond the surface and relying on intuition, empathy, and emotions to truly understand and appreciate what is essential in life.

02/07/24, 8:09 am - Dr Raguram: When poets write about nature, it is not merely about the landscape around them, but on how they perceive it. Wislawa Szymborska, the Polish Nobel Laureate’s poem, ‘View with a Grain of Sand’, is a poem painted with an engaging palette of words. The poet makes us think differently about objects and things we see and name. The objects we see do not know their names or their purposes. Likewise, sand does not know that it is sand. We give it an identity and call it sand within the frameworks of our language. Wislawa Szymborska draws our attention not just to the sand, but how we understand, comprehend and construct a sense of identity about objects around us. 
A few lines from the poem;
“We call it a grain of sand,
but it calls itself neither grain nor sand.
It does just fine without a name,
whether general, particular,
permanent, passing,
incorrect, or apt.
Our glance, our touch mean nothing to it.
It doesn't feel itself seen and touched.
And that it fell on the windowsill
is only our experience, not its.
For it, it is no different from falling on anything else
with no assurance that it has finished falling
or that it is falling still”.
The tapestry of words that she weaves, is intricate and magical.
And I keep reading, re-reading and reflecting on these lines from another of her poem, ‘Water’
“There are not enough mouths to utter
all your fleeting names, O water.
Emerson said it succinctly “The world is emblematic. Parts of speech are metaphors, because the whole of nature is a metaphor of the human mind”.

04/07/24, 9:48 am - Dr Raguram: Van Mahotsav is an annual ritual, diligently observed by the state between July 1st and 7th, every year. The occasion is heralded with planting of trees. Unfortunately most of the saplings remain largely unattended thereafter and wither till it is time for the next Van Mahotsav.
The sad fact beyond these ceremonial occasions is that the forest cover in India is dwindling at an alarming rate. . According to the India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2021, India has lost 2.33 million hectares of tree cover since 2000, with the highest loss in 2017 at 189,000 hectares. In 2023, the country lost 144,000 hectares, the highest in the last six years. In addition, the quality of India's forests has also deteriorated, with 9,117 square kilometres of forest turning into barren lands and scrubs between 2019 and 2021. Fixing the forest cover by planting a new one is an endlessly impossible task, as the life of the forest takes its own time. 
Forests are critical to reduce and sequester carbon dioxide, protect habitats for millions of species, and ensure the health and wellbeing of people. As we search for a route to a sustainable future, we need to halt deforestation. Keeping forests standing is the most cost-effective of celebrating Van Mahotsav
Gieve Patel, a poet and artist whom I admire immensely, describes the cruelty of man in killing/destroying the tree with a touch of irony in this poem;
ON KILLING A TREE
It takes much time to kill a tree,
Not a simple jab of the knife

Will do it. It has grown
Slowly consuming the earth,
Rising out of it, feeding
Upon its crust, absorbing
Years of sunlight, air, water,
And out of its leperous hide
Sprouting leaves.

So hack and chop
But this alone wont do it.
Not so much pain will do it.
The bleeding bark will heal
And from close to the ground
Will rise curled green twigs,
Miniature boughs
Which if unchecked will expand again
To former size.

No,
The root is to be pulled out -
Out of the anchoring earth;
It is to be roped, tied,
And pulled out - snapped out
Or pulled out entirely,
Out from the earth-cave,
And the strength of the tree exposed,
The source, white and wet,
The most sensitive, hidden
For years inside the earth.

Then the matter
Of scorching and choking
In sun and air,
Browning, hardening,
Twisting, withering,
And then it is done.

05/07/24, 8:28 am - Dr Raguram: On the 4th of July in 1855, Walt Whitman self-published his first edition of Leaves of Grass, a volume of twelve poems. He pronounced that “This is no book, / Who touches this touches a man.” It had a lengthy preface in which he reflected on various aspects of life “Love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give alms to everyone that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your income and labour to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have patience and indulgence toward the people, take off your hat to nothing known or unknown or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of families, read these leaves in the open air every season of every year of your life, re-examine all you have been told at school or church or in any book, dismiss whatever insults your own soul, and your very flesh shall be a great poem and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in the silent lines of its lips and face and between the lashes of your eyes and in every motion and joint of your body.”
The initial print run of the first edition was modest and the book did not sell well. It did receive a number of rave reviews in New York newspapers and some of them were written by Whitman himself. Whitman was undeterred and continued to add poems to ‘Leaves of Grass’ in four different editions and finished the last revision on his deathbed in 1892.
The poems in the ‘Leaves of Grass‘ represent Whitman's celebration of his philosophy of life and nature. Throughout the book, Whitman emphasizes the importance of connecting with nature and finding solace, inspiration, and spiritual fulfilment in the natural world. He sees nature as a source of wisdom and renewal, and encourages readers to forge a deeper connection with the environment around them. 
“Smile O voluptuous coolbreathed earth!
Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!
Earth of departed sunset! Earth of the mountains misty-top!
Earth of vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!
Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!
Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!
Far-swooping elbowed earth! Rich apple-blossomed earth!

07/07/24, 8:55 am - Dr Raguram: I was listening to Mahler’s ‘The Song of the Earth’ symphony the other day. It is interspersed with six songs. I couldn’t follow the lyrics and checked for them in the net. It was an interesting discovery! The songs are based on a set of poems, ‘The Chinese Flute’, dating back to the Tang dynasty. Curious to know further, I searched for their translation and found that each one of them was so meaningful. For instance, Mahler employed two poems; Mong Kao-Yen “Staying at a Teacher’s Mountain retreat and Awaiting a Friend in Vain” and Wang Wei’s “Farewell”. The final lines are:
“I shall no longer seek the far horizon
Still is my heart and awaits its hour….
The lovely earth everywhere blossoms and grows anew
Everywhere and forever the luminous blue of distant space….Forever…forever…”
The word forever is repeated nine times indication that forever there will be beauty, sadness, tears and happiness in all our life experiences.  
Listening to ‘The Song of the Earth’ was a revelation as to how poetry can be combined seamlessly with beautiful orchestration to create a magical listening experience.
I read further about Mahler and found that he experienced a slew of losses in his life; the death of his closest brother at the age of 13; his sister at the age of 26; and the suicide of another brother and the loss of his elder daughter. In addition, Mahler himself had serious health problems, sometimes life-threatening, throughout his life. 
This draws attention to the significant interface between adversity and creativity. Often a crucible of challenges is a fertile ground for the seeds of creativity to emerge and flourish. Creativity also serves as a coping mechanism in the face of adversity, providing individuals with an avenue for self-expression and can be a therapeutic outlet too. 
As the life of Gustav Mahler informs us, in the face of adversity creativity is a guiding light. 
(Gustav Mahler 7th July 1860 – 18th May 1911)

08/07/24, 9:04 am - Dr Raguram: With advances in health care, dying is increasingly becoming lonely, mechanical and dehumanized. To assist and help people cope with a demanding end of life process, one has to listen to them. This is what Elisabeth Kubler-Ross did. Along with four of her students she conducted a series of interviews with the terminally ill which resulted in her path breaking book, ‘On Death and Dying.’ The book outlined five stages of grief, popularly referred to as DABDA: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance. 
Though her work brought death and dying out of the closet, Elisabeth Kubler-Ross’s legacy has been a mixed one. There has been critical re-examination of the stages she has outlined and whether these stages apply to everyone who is grieving, since her research focused only on those who were terminally ill. Empirical evidence for these stages was also scanty. The well conducted Yale Bereavement Study did not find support for Kübler-Ross’s five stage theory.  The findings indicated that acceptance was the most commonly reported reaction from the start, and yearning was the most common negative feature for the first two years. The other variables, such as disbelief, depression and anger were typically absent or minimal. Moreover, her model described how people with terminal illness face their imminent death. But strangely, it was soon adapted as a way of thinking about grief in general. The process of death and dying is not purely enacted within the individual and is impacted by a host of social, religious and cultural factors which is noticeably absent in her work. Perhaps the abiding appeal of her work is in its simplicity. 
Her later years were mired in scandals. She began to embrace spiritualism, claiming she had communicated with spirits of the dead with names like “Mario,” “Anka,” “Salem,” and “Willie.” She started believing in reincarnation, and told listeners she had lived during the time of Jesus, when she had been named Isabel. She involved herself in a cult-like retreat with a psychic called Jay Barham. and conducted séances which involved the widows/widowers ‘engaging’ with the departed. It was revealed that Barham molested female participants during séances, while pretending to be an "afterlife entity". Her professional reputation began to decline and she also became largely confined to bed due to a series of strokes. 
In the final stages of her life she observed, “I now know that the purpose of my life is more than these stages. I have been married, had kids, then grandkids, written books, and travelled. I have loved and lost, and I am so much more than five stages. And so are you.”

09/07/24, 9:28 am - Dr Raguram: I am besotted with gardens. When I walk through a garden I am enveloped in a symphony of colors, rustling leaves, bird and insect sounds wafting through the air. It is an immersive experience imbued with a sense of tranquillity. As Bacon commented, “it is the purest of human pleasure.” Gardens are often seen as a refuge, a place to forget the "real" life that lies outside. But they are also quintessential healing spaces. 
Oliver Sacks, the famed neurologist and author, whose birthday falls today, wrote a small, wonderful essay “Why We Need Gardens,” in his book “Everything in Its Place: First Loves and Last Tales,” which was published posthumously. Since his place of work was just across the road from the New York Botanical Garden, he noticed how patients who were unable to function inside a hospital setting seemed to come alive in the garden. An elderly lady with Parkinson’s disease, often frozen, unable to initiate movement was more mobile in the garden and even climbed the rocks up and down many times, unattended. Patients with very advanced dementia who had difficulty in even tying their shoe laces, when put in front of a flower bed with some seedlings knew exactly what to do. He described such deep bonds people have with gardens as “hortophilia.” In his words, “I cannot say exactly how nature exerts its calming and organizing effects on our brains, but I have seen in my patients the restorative and healing powers of nature and gardens, even for those who are deeply disabled neurologically. In many cases, gardens and nature are more powerful than any medication”. He went on to add, “In forty years of medical practice, I have found only two types of non-pharmaceutical ‘therapy’ to be vitally important for patients with chronic neurological diseases: music and gardens.”
Gardens saturate our awareness and the boundary between our self and the world fuses and we feel more alive and flourish in that moment. It leaves a lasting trace in the innards of our minds.
For Thich Nhat Hanh, garden was a metaphor for the mind. He wrote, “First, you have to take care of your own garden and master the art of gardening. In each one of us there are flowers and there is also garbage. The garbage is the anger, fear, discrimination, and jealousy within us. If you water the garbage, you will strengthen the negative seeds. If you water the flowers of compassion, understanding, and love, you will strengthen the positive seeds. What you grow is up to you.”

10/07/24, 10:59 pm - Nalini N R: Whatever be the controversies about the stages, this quote holds weight. The kind of death, the age at the time of death, duration of illness, the depth of relationships etc define the grief.
10/07/24, 11:07 pm - Nalini N R: Oh. Wonderful is a superficial word for this photograph. From death to life...It is so important to connect with nature and 'live'....

11/07/24, 8:45 am - Dr Raguram: People have been drawing and painting flowers for a very long time. In contrast to botanical illustration, botanical artwork emphasizes the aesthetic value of the plant or flower but without much of the details illustrated in the former. The artist tries to capture the essence of the dainty plant form in all its inherent beauty.
One of the most celebrated flower painter in the entire history of botanical art was Pierre-Joseph Redouté. Nicknamed “the Raphael of flowers,” he was one of the most talented botanical artists ever known. He was also arguably the most popular botanical artist in history. Redouté was patronized by the kings of France from Louis XVI to Louis-Philippe and their wives. In his lifetime, he produced over 2,100 paintings, depicting over 1,800 different species, many of which had never been rendered before. Even now, each of his paintings fetch incredible prices at auction. Fortunately many of his original works are available in the digital world for us to savour.
In the accompanying image, Redoute’s painting of a tulip is on the left and on the right is one of my photographs of the flower. What I captured through my lens is a pale image of the flower lusciously portrayed in exquisite detail by the talented Redoute.
As Edvard Munch commented, “Nature is not only all that is visible to the eye… it also includes the inner pictures of the soul.” And a flower seen through a painter’s eyes has a transcendental quality which a photograph can rarely match.

12/07/24, 9:53 am - Dr Raguram: I've read DT Suzuki’s book on Zen Buddhism long time ago. I am not sure what led me to pull the book out of the shelf a few days ago. And on the page I randomly picked, there was this comment, “Outwardly, be open; inwardly, be deep.” And it resonated with me in an inexplicable way.
I consider Zen to be the best source of guidance for people like me who do not strictly adhere to any religious camp but drawn by a spiritual quest. I especially like that Zen has no need for God or any other supernatural entity. The quirky Zen tales and anecdotes fascinate me, even though I have trouble grasping them, sometime. 
DT Suzuki is responsible for a clear and simple introduction to the essentials of Zen Buddhism. Carl Jung wrote a remarkable foreword to Suzuki's Introduction to Zen Buddhism. Zen is an experience not confined to the intellect. As Jung wrote in the introduction, “A monk once went to Gensha, and wanted to learn where the entrance to the path of truth was. Gensha asked him, "Do you hear the murmuring of the brook?" "Yes, I hear it," answered the monk. "There is the entrance," the master instructed him. 
Zen Buddhism aspires to seek meaning without insisting upon belief. As Suzuki wrote perceptively, “The idea of Zen is to catch life as it flows. There is nothing extraordinary or mysterious about Zen. I raise my hand; I take a book from the other side of the desk; I hear the boys playing ball outside my window; I see the clouds blown away beyond the neighbouring wood: — in all these I am practising Zen, I am living Zen. No wordy discussion is necessary, nor any explanation. I do not know why and there is no need of explaining, but when the sun rises the whole world dances with joy and everybody’s heart is filled with bliss. If Zen is at all conceivable, it must be taken hold of here.”
As for me, all of us live our lives on the edge of the vast sea of consciousness, sometimes caressed by waves of awareness and it is a zen moment.

12/07/24, 12:55 pm - Nalini N R: What a contrast. An artist's inner self defines the beauty of the painting. The suppleness, veins, natural texture everything is so visible in a painting. But as you have pointed out it is par excellence.
12/07/24, 1:11 pm - Nalini N R: We bind ourselves too much with the world. Religion rituals I feel take us away from True spirituality. Thank you Sir for this post.
16/07/24, 9:50 am - Dr Raguram: Goddess Kali is the first of the Dasa Mahavidyas, the ten aspects or forms of Shakti.  She is the quintessential embodiment of Shakti embodying the power of creation and destruction in one entity. She is perceived as Mother Nature, primordial, nurturing, creating, and devouring all at once. In Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa’s words she is “the benign all-loving Mother.” He felt in her breath “the soothing touch of tender love and saw in her the seed of immortality.” 
There is a carefully chiselled sculpture of her in the Hoysaleshewara temple at Halebidu. She is seen holding a trident, damaru, knife and a severed head in her four hands. A garland of severed heads adorns her. Around her are corpses and one of them is seen dancing too.  
Looking at her, I wonder whether the severed head is indicative that we should severe the human ego in order to exit from the cycle of life and rebirth.
Mary Starton was a gifted writer and she was best known and most highly regarded as a poet. In a collection of her poetry ‘A Grain of Mustard Seed’, she wrote an evocative poem about Goddess Kali. 
INVOCATION TO KALI
“Kali, be with us.
Violence, destruction, receive our homage.
Help us to bring darkness into the light,
To lift out the pain, the anger,
Where it can be seen for what it is—
The balance-wheel for our vulnerable, aching love.
Put the wild hunger where it belongs,
Within the act of creation,
Crude power that forges a balance
Between hate and love.
Help us to be the always hopeful
Gardeners of the spirit
Who know that without darkness
Nothing comes to birth
As without light
Nothing flowers.
Bear the roots in mind,
You, the dark one, Kali,
Awesome power.”

18/07/24, 9:41 am - Dr Raguram: Why are people so besotted with the weddings of the “rich and famous?” I am a strong advocate of Kuvempu, one of the greatest poets of Kannada, who propounded the idea of a distinctly different kind of marriage which he called, ‘Mantra Mangalya’. It is a revolutionary approach to bring back marriage to the folds of personal Dharma freed from the clutches of hedonism and ritualistic customs. It is a simple marriage ceremony devoid of pomp to teach couples the seriousness and sacredness of marriage, encouraging them to adopt the values inherent in this method throughout their lives. 
Mantra Mangalya is available as a manual. It has three sections. The first one explains what Mantra Mangalya is, “It is a type of marriage in which the bride and the groom invoke the power symbolising all the values worshipped by Indians since times immemorial”. It goes on to add, “The objective of Mantra Mangalya is to liberate Indians from the rituals which are indirectly responsible for evils of caste system, gender inequality and untouchability. As this mode of marriage has to be simple, no part of the wedding shall be expensive or ostentatious. No one shall receive dowry in any form.” 
The next section has meticulous instructions on the conduct of the ceremony. The total number of invitees including parents and relations should not exceed 200. Gifts are prohibited. No particular time is auspicious or inauspicious. Mantra Mangalya believes that the whole life of man is auspicious for making life fruitful. Photographs of four Mahapurushas such as Ramakrishna Parmahamsa and Sharada Devi or of any ideal couple shall be placed as spiritual witnesses. 
The third section is titled “Marriage Code”. It is an extra-ordinary set of statements meant to be administered to the bride and groom. It reiterates that the wife is equal to the husband, enjoying the same freedom and emphasizes the crucial role of affective bond between the spouses as an important aspect to sustain relationship. It ends by stating that “the bride and groom who are now unfettered from all religions, rituals, and ignorance, should continue this sacred duty of unfettering humanity. There is no need to belong to any religion. There is no need to belong to any sect. There is no need to follow any rituals. The aforementioned oaths are the guiding lights in your life.”

19/07/24, 10:34 am - Dr Raguram: After completing PUC, I had quite a bit of time before venturing into a professional course and I spent most of this time cycling to Eswari Lending Library in Chennai. One day when I was browsing, I noticed AJ Cronin’s ‘The Citadel’, in one of the shelves. I’ve never heard of him before. I brought it back home and finished reading it in one setting. 
‘Citadel’ tells the story of Andrew Manson, a young, idealistic doctor, who moves to a small mining town. He soon finds that he is dealing with more than what he’d bargained for. There is a lot of poverty in the town, many miners suffering from lung diseases. He begins to notice how doctors often lack clinical competence and are part of the system which really doesn’t help the people the way it should. He carefully studies the lung afflictions of the miners and completes his thesis detailing it. The research gains him a post with the "Mines Fatigue Board" in London, but he resigns after six months to set up a private practice. Seduced by the thought of making easy money from wealthy clients, he drifts away from the principles he started with and is estranged from his wife. When he notices the death of a patient because of a surgeon's ineptitude, he abandons his practice and returns to his wife to begin his life afresh. Tragically she is run over by a bus and dies. 
In this novel, Cronin draws attention to the moral dilemmas that beset the doctors and the conflicts between the demands of private medicine as a business and of medicine as a Platonic ideal. He deftly identifies many of the issues in clinical practice which needs to be tackled like adequate training of doctors to prepare them for the reality of practice in the community, better supervision of young doctors, importance of team based care and the crucial role of ethics in medicine. As Cronin commented, “I have written in ‘The Citadel’ all I feel about the medical profession, its injustices, its hide-bound unscientific stubbornness, its humbug… The horrors and inequities detailed in the story I have personally witnessed. This is not an attack against individuals, but against a system.”
In choosing the title for the novel, I wonder whether Cronin is prescient in alluding that modern health care system has become an impenetrable citadel where doctors ensconce and fortify themselves in defensive practices, highlighting in the process, the importance of opening the doors of the fortress.
Reading, for me is like stepping into worlds that I am not aware of. As a youngster, ‘Citadel’ opened my eyes to the varied landscapes of the practice of medicine and perhaps also played a role in my choice of the profession.
Stories can change lives…

I attended one of my closest relaive's son's marriage, the whole expenditure of the ceremony shared by the couple (which was very less comparatively). The ceremony lasted for one hour and it was the groom and bride who mattered. I really appreciated as the focus was on the sacredness of the bond.

20/07/24, 8:06 am - Dr Raguram: Literature is replete with evocative portraits of romantic love in its many facets. The Greeks had three expressions to designate love: Eros, Philos and Agape. Eros is love between two persons that perpetuates the human race. Philos is the sentiment that we dedicate to our friends. Finally, Agape, which contains both Eros and Philos, is total love; the love that we give spontaneously to others, regardless of reciprocation, which devours those who feel it. 
One of the most endearing expression of love in literature is that of Petrarch. He was an Italian scholar and poet and is considered as one of the founders of the Renaissance movement in arts and literature. His most famous work is his ‘Canzoniere’, a collection of love poems written in the vernacular which revolve around an unknown and unobtainable woman called Laura.
In sonnet 353, titled ‘The Wandering Bird’ he articulates poignantly, his love for Laura and the unbearable loss after her demise. 
“Sweet wandering bird that singest on thy way,
Or mournest yet the time for ever past,
Watching night come and spring receding fast,
Day’s bliss behind thee and the seasons gay,—
If thou my griefs against thine own couldst weigh,
Thou couldst not guess how long my sorrows last;
Yet thou mightst hide thee from the wintry blast
Within my breast, and thus my pains allay.
Yet may not all thy woes be named with mine,
Since she whom thou dost mourn may live, yet live,
But death and heaven still hold my spirit’s bride;
And all those long past days of sad decline
With all the joys remembered years can give
Still bid me ask “Sweet bird! with me abide!”
Petrarch is so consumed by grief following the death of the woman he loves that he begins to see sorrow in the world around him. He hears the song of the bird and imagines that every note is stricken with grief. The bird is a symbol of the deep pain and suffering Petrarch endures after the death of Laura. He talks to the bird and hopes that the bird can sympathize with his pain because there is no one else to talk with. 
When poets dip their pen in emotions deeply entrenched in the innermost recesses of their hearts, love, longing and loss comes alive…

21/07/24, 6:48 am - Dr Raguram: Today is dedicated to expressing gratitude and reverence to teachers. The term Guru is derived from the Sanskrit, ‘Gu’ meaning darkness and ‘ru’ signifying light. 
Guru Paduka Stotram is a hymn which draws attention to the importance and influence of a Guru in one’s life. One day, Adi Shankaracharya was travelling across the country in search of his Master, Govind Bhagavatpada when he came upon a cave on the banks of River Narmada. He saw a pair of padukas or sandals outside the cave and immediately recognized them as that of his Master. Filled with abundant joy, he penned the ‘Guru Paduka Stotram.’ Padukas are symbolically representative of the ‘the boat to help cross the endless ocean of life’. It is a beautiful hymn which ends with these verses.
कामादिसर्प व्रजगारुडाभ्यां विवेकवैराग्य निधिप्रदाभ्याम् ।
बोधप्रदाभ्यां दृतमोक्षदाभ्यां नमो नमः श्रीगुरुपादुकाभ्याम् ॥
That which is the Garuda which drives off the serpents of passion,
That which provides one with the treasure of wisdom and renunciation,
That which blesses one with refined wisdom,
And that which blesses the aspirant with speedy salvation,
Salutations to such sacred sandals of my revered Guru.
Sri Dakshinamurthy is regarded as the quintessential  guru, an embodiment of knowledge and the destroyer of ignorance. These images of Sri Dakshinamurthy are from Brahmapureeswarar temple at Pullamangai. In the Koshtam on the southern side, there is an entrancing idol of Sri Dakshinamurthy with two more depictions of the Lord, above, in the Vimana.

24/07/24, 9:05 am - Dr Raguram: Hermits have been around in every historical era, across all geographical locales. In nearly all cultures of the world, we find people who chose to live differently, often in solitary existence. Japan has a long tradition of hermits and Kamo no Chomei was a famous recluse during the medieval times. After living through calamitous time, at the age of fifty, Chomei renounced the world, became a hermit and built a small hut for himself in the mountains. In this retreat, he spent his time, observing signs of change in the seasons: wisteria blossoms in spring, summer cuckoos, autumns insect chirping, and snow in winter and meditating. Chomei was a poet and he wrote about his experiences in a book, ‘Hojoki.’ It’s opening phrases are lyrical, 
“The flowing river 
never stops
and yet the water
never stays
the same. 
Foam floats
upon the pools
scattering, re-forming
never lingering long. 
So it is with man
and all his dwelling places
here on earth.”
Writing about life spent in quietude, he observes:
“Fish do not hate the water.
But then, none can know
the happiness of the fish
unless he is one.
Birds love the woods.
If you are not a bird
you will not know its truths.
A quiet life is much the same. 
How would anyone know it 
without living it?”
Having spent his life in seclusion, Chomei is profoundly reflective in the final passages of the ‘Hojoki’ wondering whether he has adhered to the essential teaching of the Buddha.
“The moon of my life is setting. 
The life now left me sinks into the hills. 
Any time now I may descend
to the darkness of the river below.
To what end do I pour this out?
Buddha taught we must not be attached.
Yet the way I love this hut is itself attachment.
To be attached to the quiet and serene
must likewise be a burden”
(Kamo no Chomei died on July 24, 1216)
Dr Raguram
24/07/24, 10:51 pm - Nalini N R: His life in the hills reminds me of the Vanaprasthashrama. But his concern about the attachment to the hut and serene atmosphere is so moving... Doesn't appear that he craved for it...

25/07/24, 9:00 am - Dr Raguram: Birds are nature’s original poems. Once you start to hear birds, notice them, learn their habits, the world around you opens up in beautiful ways. Our lives would be charmless without them. Their songs give solace to the weary soul. There are thousands of beautiful poems written about birds by poets all over the world. Many turned to them for inspiration at various points in their writing as birds provide boundless metaphors. For example, the singing of the nightingale becomes a metaphor for writing poetry in Shelley’s works, “A poet is a nightingale, who sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet sounds; his auditors are as men entranced by the melody of an unseen musician, who feel that they are moved and softened, yet know not whence or why.” 
The nightingale is a recurrent theme in poetry. Samuel Taylor Coleridge (21 October 177 - 25 July 1834), famed author of ‘Rime of the Ancient Mariner’ lived in the Chanters House which had a Victorian bird house with an aviary. He wrote about the nightingale too;
“Many a nightingale perch giddily
On blossomy twig still swinging from the breeze,
And to that motion tune his wanton song
Like tipsy Joy that reels with tossing head.”
Poetry for Coleridge, “has been to me its own exceeding great reward; it has given me the habit of wishing to discover the good and beautiful in all that meets and surrounds me.”
(The accompanying image is that of the Northern Mockingbird which is commonly called the “American Nightingale.” It lives up to its nickname, singing during the day and sometimes at night, varying its songs from spring to fall. The Northern Mockingbird can sing up to 30 differing bird songs)

26/07/24, 9:41 am - Dr Raguram: There are two books of CG Jung which I treasure and value deeply. One is Volume 16 of his Collected Works which explores psychotherapy and the other one is the autobiographical ‘Memories, Dreams and Reflections.’ The latter book offers fascinating glimpses about his evolution as a mental health professional.
Jung spent some time at the famous ‘Burgholzi’. He describes his experiences there with extraordinary candour: “Psychiatry teachers were not interested in what the patient had to say, but rather in how to make a diagnosis or how to describe symptoms and to compile statistics. From the clinical point of view which then prevailed, the human personality of the patient, his individuality, did not matter at all. Rather, the doctor was confronted with Patient X, with a long list of cut-and-dried diagnoses and a detailing of symptoms. Patients were labelled, rubber-stamped with a diagnosis, and, for the most part, that settled the matter. The psychology of the patient played no role whatsoever.”
There is also a vivid account of an extraordinary encounter with a patient. A young woman was admitted with the diagnosis of ‘dementia praecox.’ Jung felt that it was a case of depression but did not voice his opinion, fearing rebuke from seniors. He sat with the patient over many days, gently exploring the background to her distress and it revealed a dark story. Before her current marriage, she was keen to marry the son of a wealthy industrialist.  Five years later, an old friend visited her and he said to her, "When you got married it was quite a shock to your Mr. X.”  She started brooding about the loss of her love. She lived in a place where the water supply was not perfectly hygienic; there was pure spring water for drinking, and impure water from the river for bathing and washing. While she was bathing her young daughter, she saw the child sucking at the impure water but did not stop her as she was quite preoccupied. A short time later the girl came down with typhoid fever and died. She was tremendously distressed and was admitted in Burgholzi. Jung started speaking to her over the next few weeks and she was able to acknowledge and work through her distress and guilt. She got better and was discharged. 
In Jung’s words, “In many cases in psychiatry, the patient who comes to us has a story that is not told, and which as a rule no one knows of. To my mind, therapy only really begins after the investigation of that wholly personal story. It is the patient's secret, the rock against which he is shattered. If I know his secret story, I have a key to the treatment. The doctor's task is to find out how to gain that knowledge. In therapy the problem is always the whole person, never the symptom alone.”
This facet of Jung, not so well known, draws attention to importance of the transformative power of narration in psychotherapy. Stories that are told in therapy are the stories that cannot be told in everyday life. The role of the therapist is to offer a space to share such stories and facilitate emergence of alternate versions and make them feel confident to try them out in their lives. 
Dr Raguram

27/07/24, 9:24 am - Dr Raguram: Mangroves are enchanting places. Our sojourn amidst the mangroves of the Zuari river remains deeply etched in memory. Zuari River is the largest river in Goa which divides the state into two parts; North Goa and South Goa. It’s a tidal river, which sustains this important ecosystem. We boarded the boat at the Courtalim ferry pier and as we slowly coursed along the wide swatches of mangroves, a wide array of birds kept us company. Numerous species of water birds were foraging the shallow marshy banks for food. One of the birds that caught our attention was the black capped kingfisher which was perched on a swaying branch. As we were leaving an Indian Mugger Crocodile cast a lazy glance at us from its muddy abode.
Mangrove forests are among the planet’s most complex ecosystems. The word "mangrove" comes from the Portuguese word mangue, which means "tree", and the English word "grove", which refers to trees and shrubs in sandy, muddy, or shallow areas. Mangroves are survivors flourishing in environmental conditions that would swiftly kill most other types of vegetation. Known as the dancing trees, mangroves are regularly battered by cyclonic winds, especially along the coasts of India, but their intertwined breathing root system anchors them firm on the soil. They play a crucial role in protecting coastal areas from tsunamis. Mangroves are critical ecosystems sustaining a wide array of biodiversity.  
Let me end this post paying obeisance to a remarkable man who was instrumental in developing and conserving mangroves in Kerala. Pokkudan, who grew by the lap of the estuaries and the rich rivers of Ezhom recognized the importance of mangroves. With remarkable determination, he would set out on his country boat everyday along the waters to plant saplings of mangroves in the marshes.  He not only planted acres of mangrove saplings but ensured their protection against tremendous odds, until they emerged as teeming mangrove forests. Over a span of two and a half decades, Pokkudan had planted over hundreds of thousands of mangrove saplings along the banks of the Pazhayangadi River in the Kannur district, which earned him the sobriquet as ‘Kandal Pokkudan’ (Kandal is mangrove in Malayalam). Pokkudan describes his efforts poetically in his autobiography, ‘Kandalkadukalkidayil Ente Jeevitham’ (My Life Among the Mangrove Forests) “I began by planting 300 mangrove plants to prevent the sea from eroding the coast and to shield the children walking to the school from the gusts of wind. And to soak in their beauty when they grew up.” He passed away in 2015 leaving behind a great legacy.

28/07/24, 6:17 pm - Dr Raguram: Grandmothers are endless sources of engaging stories and delectable food. When we were young, there was no concept of an evening ‘tiffin’. Instead of tea and biscuits, the leftover food from the morning will take a new mouth-watering avatar in the evening. All the kids of the house will sit around the grandmother as she placed a dollop of delicious, recycled food in our hands while narrating a story. It was always a very special moment for all of us.
I travelled back in time reminiscing about these moments when I read the poem “Butterfly Laughter" by Katherine Mansfield.
“In the middle of our porridge plates
There was a blue butterfly painted
And each morning we tried who should reach the
          butterfly first.
Then the Grandmother said:  "Do not eat the poor
          butterfly."
That made us laugh.
Always she said it and always it started us laughing.
It seemed such a sweet little joke.
I was certain that one fine morning
The butterfly would fly out of our plates,
Laughing the teeniest laugh in the world,
And perch on the Grandmother's lap.”
The grandmother has made a porridge for the children and she painted a blue butterfly on top of it to make the food attractive. There is a competition among all the children as to who will eat that butterfly first. When the grandmother remarks, "Do not eat the poor butterfly", they start laughing. The poet wonders what the grandmother’s reaction would be if the butterfly comes alive and sits on her lap! 
“That butterfly
Will land on us
One day
When wrinkles arrive
And we get old”

02/08/24, 8:39 am - Dr Raguram: It is a harrowing sight to see the immense devastation and intense human suffering in Wayanad. It is difficult to express their pain and travails in words. Sometimes poets express it poignantly. Pablo Neruda wrote a poem; 
FLOOD
“The poor live on low ground waiting for the river
to rise one night and sweep them out to sea.
I’ve seen small cradles floating by, the wrecks
of house, chairs, and a great rage of ash—
pale water draining terror from the sky:
this is all yours, poor man, for your wife and crop,
dog and tools, for you to learn to beg.
No water climbs to the homes of gentlemen
whose snowy collars flutter on the line.
It feeds on this rolling mire, these ruins winding
their idle course to the sea with your dead,
among rough cut tables and the luckless trees
that bob and tumble turning up bare root.”
Pablo Neruda draws attention to the effects of flooding on poor communities. The poor often live in low-lying areas that are periodically flooded due to heavy rains because these are the only places they can afford. These floods often result in the loss of lives and belongings. Neruda contrasts the terror and losses from flooding that the poor endure with that of the rich, who can afford to build houses on higher ground where no rising waters come close to their homes.

05/08/24, 8:51 am - Dr Raguram: Hyde Park was a favourite haunt of mine during my fellowship years in London, decades ago. It is an urban oasis in the midst of busy, bustling London. The park is dotted with monuments and statues and on one occasion I came across an intriguing relief, which I couldn’t figure out. Later, I discovered that it depicts a mysterious girl, ‘Rima’ from the book ‘Green Mansions’ written by WH Hudson. Curious to find out more about the author, I learnt that he was a founder-member of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), in 1889. RSPB had 20,000 members at that time, majority of them women. Hudson was a meticulous observer of nature and during a sojourn to Patagonia, he identified a flycatcher which is named after him. He also authored a series of ornithological studies. 
Hudson’s writings are quite lyrical, ”The blue sky, the brown soil beneath, the grass, the trees, the animals, the wind, and rain, and stars are never strange to me; for I am in and of and am one with them; and my flesh and the soil are one, and the heat in my blood and in the sunshine are one, and the winds and the tempests and my passions are one.”
I particularly like his observation about the humming bird, “Have you ever observed a humming-bird moving about in an aerial dance among the flowers--a living prismatic gem that changes its colour with every change of position.”
Hudson was ahead of his time and believed in studying his subjects in the field, not just in the laboratory. He would spend long hours quietly watching, listening, and being with nature. “when walking there one day, the loveliness of that green leafy world, its silence and its melody and the divine sunlight, so wrought on me that for a few precious moments it produced a mystical state, that rare condition of beautiful illusions when the feet are off the ground, when, on some occasions, we appear to be one with nature, unbodied like the poet's bird, floating, diffused in it.”
He was admired by Virginia Woolf and Joseph Conrad, who declared that he wrote ‘as the good God makes the grass grow’.

06/08/24, 8:11 am - Dr Raguram: When we were in Bandipur some months ago, I noticed this little bird peeping out of its nest and I was reminded of a simple, beautiful poem by Alfred Tennyson whose birthday is today.
WHAT DOES THAT LITTLE BIRDIE SAY
“What does little birdie say,
In her nest at peep of day?
“Let me fly,” says little birdie—
“Mother, let me fly away.”
“Birdie, rest a little longer,
Till the little wings are stronger.”
So she rests a little longer,
Then she flies away.
What does little baby say
In her bed at peep of day?
Baby says, like little birdie,
“Let me rise and fly away.”
“Baby, sleep a little longer,
Till the little limbs are stronger.
If she sleeps a little longer,
Baby, too, shall fly away.”
It is a touching poem about a bird's desire to leave the nest and experience the world. The mother, gently advises the young bird to stay and rest, as its wings are not yet strong enough to fly. The poem ends by hinting that eventually the little bird will soon fly away. All of us aspire for independence and exploration, but need the guidance and protection of our parents till we find the metier to be on our own.
All of us are born to fly. As the master strategist Napoleon Bonaparte is said to have commented, “Until you spread your wings, you’ll have no idea how far you can fly.”  
(I scrupulously avoid nest photography and this was taken from a distance with utmost care that the bird doesn’t sense my presence!)

07/08/24, 10:21 am - Dr Raguram: India is a land of festivals. Traditions and rituals associated with it vary across the vast cultural landscape of India. For instance, today is celebrated as Hariyali Teej in many states in Northern India to commemorate the union of Shiva and Parvati.
Triyuginarayan temple is situated at the confluence of Mandakini and Son-Ganga river in Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand. It is a much sought after wedding destination as it is said to be the place where the celestial marriage of Shiva and Parvati took place. Parvati, daughter to Himavat was keen to marry Shiva and undertook rigorous penance to prove her love and dedication to Shiva at Gauri Kund, which is not very far from Triyuginarayan. Gauri Kund temple, which dedicated to Parvati, is also the base camp for trekking to Kedarnath Temple. Mythology states that Shiva proposed to Parvati at Guptakashi and got married in the Triyuginarayan temple. A holy fire still burns perpetually in front of the temple and the ashes from this fire are supposed to promote conjugal bliss. 
There are many sculptural depictions of the celestial event of the marriage of Shiva and Parvati. Perhaps one of most beautiful one is at the 10th century Bhoganandishwara temple near Bangalore. In this relief one can see Lord Brahma on the extreme right and next to him is Vishnu who is blessing the couple. In the middle are the couple, Shiva and Parvati. Next to the couple is the father of Parvati offering Kanyadan and adjoining him is Parvati’s mother. 
Embedded in rich mythological tapestry, the marriage of Shiva and Parvati is a tale that resonates with devotion, perseverance, and the enduring power of love.

08/08/24, 10:15 am - Dr Raguram: A movie that left a deep impression on me was ‘Charly’ directed by Ralph Nelson. Based on the novel ‘Flowers for Algermon’ by Daniel Keyes, It had a beautiful musical score by Pandit Ravi Shankar. It’s a timeless story that explores the experiences of Charlie Gordon, a 32-year-old man with a learning disability who undergoes surgery in an effort to make him “smarter” and more “normal.” Since the same procedure worked well on Algernon, a lab mouse, the scientists have high hopes for Charlie’s transformation. After the operation, Charlie’s intelligence begins to steadily increase and he is functionally a genius after a few months. As his intelligence grows, he finds it increasingly difficult to connect with others at an emotional level and realizes that he is losing touch with his own emotional needs and desires, “I don’t know what’s worse; to not know what you are and be happy, or to become what you’ve always wanted to be, and feel alone.” The researchers present Charlie and their findings at a scientific convention. Meanwhile Charly comes to know that Algernon has lost its enhanced intelligence and died, facts that the research team kept away from him. He starts wondering whether he will undergo a similar decline and reflects, “The problem, dear professor, is that you wanted someone who could be made intelligent but still be kept in a cage and displayed when necessary to reap the honours you seek. The hitch is that I'm a person.” Soon Charly regresses to his previous level of intelligence, but finally feels himself at home, happier than before. 
The story explores themes that are still relevant today, including intelligence, empathy, and the ethical implications of scientific advancement. More importantly, it seeks out the unflinchingly honest message that our humanity is not measured by how smart we are, but rather by our kindness, love and interaction with others.
In the era of Neurolink, the daunting question is “Does intelligence alone makes us better people?”
Charly reminds us that, “Intelligence is one of the greatest human gifts. But all too often a search for knowledge drives out the search for love. This is something else I've discovered for myself very recently. I present it to you as a hypothesis: Intelligence without the ability to give and receive affection leads to mental and moral breakdown, to neurosis, and possibly even psychosis. And I say that the mind absorbed in and involved in itself as a self-centered end, to the exclusion of human relationships, can only lead to violence and pain.”

10/08/24, 8:54 am - Dr Raguram: Just finished reading Rachel Aviv’s “Strangers to Ourselves”, a moving account of five people who were in throes of various kinds of psychological distress. The book begins with Rachel’s account of her own tryst with Anorexia Nervosa when she was young. Her disinclination to eat occurred on the background of her parents’ divorce and her role as a pawn in their custody battle. The anorexia resolved within the year, and her doctors ended up seeing it as a coping mechanism during a demanding phase in her life. Rachel reflects, “For a child, solipsistic by nature, there are limits to the ways that despair can be communicated. Culture shapes the scripts that expressions of distress will follow. In both anorexia and resignation syndrome, children embody anger and a sense of powerlessness by refusing food, one of the few methods of protest available to them. Experts tell these children that they are behaving in a recognisable way that has a label. The children then make adjustments, conscious and unconscious, to the way that they've been classified. Over time, a willed pattern of behaviour becomes increasingly involuntary and ingrained.” As the poet Louise Gluck who was anorexic, wrote, “The tragedy of anorexia seems to me that its intent is not self-destructive, though its outcome so often is. Its intent is to construct, in the only way possible when means are so limited, a plausible self.”
All five people Rachel writes about are products of their life stories, circumstances over which they had little control. She richly documents each of their journeys in the “psychic hinterlands, the outer edges of human experience, where language tends to fail.” 
I was particularly moved by the narrative about Bapu. Her rich parents married Bapu to a man who was more keen on her money. She had to endure much abuse in the new household and sought solace in religion. She believed Lord Krishna to be her true husband who would offer unconditional love and wrote poems about him. As she merged her life with that of Lord Krishna, she abandoned the household duties, became uncommunicative, attempted multiple times to run away. She was found living on the street with other pilgrims and later confined to a mental health facility. She was taken care by her son and daughter in law. Sometime later she had a stroke, slipped into coma and died a few days later at home. After her demise, her daughter Bhargavi (whom I had known) started the Bapu Trust in Pune focusing on developing community based programs facilitating the autonomy and independence of persons living with a mental health issues 
Rachel comments perceptively, “Mental illnesses are often seen as chronic and intractable forces that take over our lives, but I wonder how much the stories we tell about them, especially in the beginning, can shape their course. People can feel freed by these stories, but they can also get stuck in them.”
In the words of Paulo Coelho, “Sometimes, we need to be strangers to ourselves. Then the hidden light in our soul will illuminate what we need to see.” 
It is a deeply moving and insightful narrative of lived experiences of people with psychological distress and needs to be widely read by all mental health professionals.

12/08/24, 9:44 am - Dr Raguram: Elephants have the longest gestation period compared to any other animal. Usually a female gives birth to a single calf, occasionally two. Calves nurse for the first six months of life, drinking about 10 litters of milk per day. Elephant milk is high in fat and protein, hundred times more than cow's milk. Calves are weaned slowly and may continue to nurse until they reach puberty or the mother gives birth again. The young ones begin to experiment with their trunks around four to six months and start picking leaves and grasses to supplement their diet.  They follow their mothers' responses to learn who is a friend or relative, and who might be a threat. The bond between a mother elephant and her calf is special because it's very strong and nurturing. The mother elephant takes care of her calf with a lot of love and protection, ensuring its safety and teaching it essential skills for survival. 
Interestingly, Priyanka Sharma wrote an article, “Being an Elephant Mom in the time of the Tiger Mother.” She observed that compared to the ‘Tiger Mums’ who push their children to make choices, behave like adults and minimize relying on parents, an ‘Elephant Mom’ parenting style is flexible; it allows children to reach out for help providing comfort and warmth to the young. This parenting style is filled with encouragement and protection. While Tiger moms prepare their children for independence and the harsh realities of life from a young age, Elephant moms strive to support their children emotionally, and create a warm and loving environment for their kids to grow. They will nurture and protect their little ones through hard time, compared to a tiger mom style, which is a parenting style that is formed on the basis of tough love.
Watching a young calf gently ambling along the mother in the wild is a sight to behold!

13/08/24, 8:56 am - Dr Raguram: Otters are some of the most adorable aquatic animals. One can spend endless hours watching their energetic play as they wrestle, play and slide down the slippery rocks. ‘Tarka the Otter’, by Henry Williamson is a lovely novel about them. When the novel was published, otters were declining in numbers and by the 1960s it seemed possible that they would become extinct in England. Their recovery was much assisted by an increase in public awareness, facilitated in part by the popular success of Williamson’s novel. He describes the hunting behaviour of the otters like a trained naturalist, “Filling her lungs with new air, she slipped into the water and swam to the other end of the islet, where a scour had been formed by the flood-rains of the last south-westerly wind. Here the grown family of the moorhen was paddling. When almost under them, the otter saw the legs and the images of legs joined to them, black in silhouette against the less dark surface. She seized one of the moorhens and drew it under, releasing it to bite it in her jaws, and carried it back to her cubs, swimming with her nose, whiskers, eyes and part of the dead fowl out of the water.”
Williamson was quite productive with over fifty novels and essays. A keen observer of the landscape around him, his forte was writing about nature in its myriad expressions, “When the bees’ feet shake the bells of the heather, and the ruddy strings of the sap-stealing dodder are twined about the green spikes of the furze, it is summertime on the commons.”
Though there was a darker side in his life, Williamson is still considered by many as a pioneer in the genre of nature writing. Even a simple description of an icicle is imbued with lyricism, “Music comes from an icicle as it melts, to live again as spring water.”

14/08/24, 10:30 am - Dr Raguram: Nature offers some of the world's purest and simplest joys. Many writers have tried to distil that experience in words. Continuing my explorations into this genre, I discovered the writings of Richard Jefferies. He was highly regarded for his essays on nature and the English countryside. When I read his works I was amazed as to how effortlessly he succeeds in translating the inherent splendour of nature into exceptionally poetic prose. His oeuvre is an exquisite eulogy for the way forays into nature dissolves the boundary between ourselves and the world. He describes such experiences eloquently, “It is eternity now. I am in the midst of it. It is about me in the sunshine; I am in it as the butterfly in the light-laden air. Nothing has to come; it is now. Now is eternity; now is the immortal life.”
His words throb with exquisite energy, “As the wind, wandering over the sea, takes from each wave an invisible portion, and brings to those on shore the ethereal essence of ocean, so the air lingering among the woods and hedges—green waves and billows—became full of fine atoms of summer. Swept from notched hawthorn leaves, broad-topped oak-leaves, narrow ash sprays and oval willows; from vast elm cliffs and sharp-taloned brambles under; brushed from the waving grasses and stiffening corn, the dust of the sunshine was borne along and breathed. Steeped in flower and pollen to the music of bees and birds, the stream of the atmosphere became a living thing. It was life to breathe it, for the air itself was life.”
The beauty of nature lingers on in his writings…

16/08/24, 10:27 am - Dr Raguram: Varalakshmi Puja is celebrated mostly in South India. Goddess Varalakshmi represents prosperity and divine grace. The name 'Varalakshmi' itself signifies her nature; 'Vara' meaning boon or blessing, and 'Lakshmi' referring to the goddess of wealth. This form of the goddess is particularly revered for her role in granting wishes and bringing prosperity. It is believed that worshipping the Goddess Varalakshmi on this day is equivalent to worshipping Ashtalakshmis; the eight goddesses of Wealth, Earth, Wisdom, Love, Fame, Peace, Contentment, and Strength.
There are iconographic variations in depiction of the Goddess. In this sculpture from Nuggehalli, Karnataka, she is found seated and has four arms. The four arms are symbolic of the four goals of humanity: dharma (pursuit of ethical, moral life), artha (pursuit of wealth, means of life), kama (pursuit of love, emotional fulfillment), and moksha (pursuit of self-knowledge, liberation). Her front right hand is held up in the abhaya mudra while her left hand is in the varada mudra giving boons to her devotees. 
Muthuswami Dishidhar composed a beautiful song ‘Sri Varalakshmi Nama Sthubhyam’ in praise of the Goddess. Most appropriately it is set in the raga Sri (one of the names of Lakshmi). It starts with the pallavi 
श्री वर लक्ष्मि नमस्तुभ्यं वसु प्रदे
श्री सारस पदे रस पदे सपदे पदे पदे
Interestingly the pallavi starting from sArasa is in form of Gopuccha Yati which begins with a set of syllables and gets one syllable smaller with each repetition. The syllables are arranged similar to a cow’s tail, which is broad at the beginning gradually tapering to the bottom. 
The pallavi translates as; 
I bow down to you, O eminent Goddess Lakshmi, the giver of boons!
O bestower of fortunes! O Sri with feet as soft as a lotus, you are the bestower of affection, be my companion at every step.

17/08/24, 9:24 am - Dr Raguram: During my earlier days at NIMHANS, I was shocked by an incident that happened not very far away from the campus. One evening when a woman was walking along the busy Double Road, she was forcefully taken away and raped. She was a married working woman who was walking home after the day’s work. I was troubled and wondered about the mind-set of the person who did the dastardly act. Wanting to understand more about rape, I went over to the Select Bookshop and asked Mr Murthy whether he could suggest a book that could offer me a broader perspective about this inhuman act. He rummaged through the crowded bookshelves and handed over a copy of Susan Brownmiller’s ‘Against Our Will’ which was published in 1975. 
It is not an easy read as it is filled with incidents and details of rape through0ut history. Susan Brownmiller outlines the history, politics, and sociology of rape and the and how it continues to profoundly affect women’s lives. What was profoundly insightful was reframing rape as an act of power, fundamental to the patriarchal domination of women. The chapter ‘Power: Institution and Authority’ best expresses the main thesis of the book that rape is the primeval and the ultimate act of subjugation. Surveys show that a vast majority of rapes are planned. This goes to disprove the theory that the rapist is usually ‘provoked’ by the flimsy clothing worn by the victim, and is overcome by an overpowering physical urge. In fact, the rapist is asserting his power and urge to dominate, “Man’s discovery that his genitalia could serve as a weapon to generate fear must rank as one of the most important discoveries in prehistoric times, along with the use of fire and the first crude stone axe. From prehistoric times to the present, rape has played a crucial function. It is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear. ...That some men rape provides a sufficient threat to keep all women in a constant state of intimidation...”
She goes on to comment, “A world without rape would be a world in which women moved freely without fear of men. That some men rape provides a sufficient threat to keep all women in a constant state of intimidation, forever conscious of the knowledge that the biological tool must be held in awe for it may turn to weapon with sudden swiftness borne of harmful intent.”
In light of the recent event in Kolkata her observation is quite prescient, “All rape is an exercise in power, but some rapists have an edge that is more than physical. They operate within an institutionalized setting that works to their advantage and in which a victim has little chance to redress her grievance.”
Even though there have been some criticisms of her perspective on rape, I agree with her that “Oppression thrives on silence. In order to resist, we must break the silence and speak out against injustice.”

One of the poetic forms that he experimented with was Triveni.  Composed of three lines, it is different from other three line verses like Haiku which are governed by a fixed syllable structure. As Gulzar commented, “I called it triveni because the first two lines meet like the Ganga and the Yamuna and complete a thought, it forms a poem on its own. But beneath the two there is the subterranean flow of another, the Saraswati. Hidden. Not visible to the eye. The triveni intends to reveal the Saraswati. The third line, lost in the first two, either changes the meaning of the poem altogether, its focus, or gives it a surprising twist, in the process creating an entirely new poem altogether.”
One of the best examples of his triveni is this one, in which he describes the flight of a bird as it leaves a branch.
उड़ के जाते हुए पंछी ने बस इतना ही देखा
देर तक हाथ हिलती रही वह शाख़ फ़िज़ा में

अलविदा कहने को ? या पास बुलाने के लिए ?
The bird in flight saw only this:
A branch waving its arm for long
To say goodbye? Or to call it back?
So many times I have seen a bird leaving a branch in a tree, like this one from the Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary in Chattisgarh, but only a gifted poet like Gulzar can embellish the experience in just three magical sentences.
In the garden of language, he's a singing bird.

19/08/24, 9:57 am - Dr Raguram: Trees are the living energy of earth. With their roots deeply entrenched in the earth, they struggle with all the forces of nature to represent and express themselves. In the forest no two trees are alike. Each one has a distinctive presence. During an early morning walk amongst the wooded terrain of the Golden Gate Park, I saw this gnarled tree with a contorted trunk and twisted branches. It communicated something that a perfectly grown tree will never convey. 
As Tom Waits observed, “In the forest, there was a crooked tree and a straight tree. Every day, the straight tree would say to the crooked tree, "Look at me...I'm tall, and I'm straight, and I'm handsome. Look at you...you're all crooked and bent over. No one wants to look at you." And they grew up in that forest together. And then one day the loggers came, and they saw the crooked tree and the straight tree, and they said, "Just cut the straight trees and leave the rest." So the loggers turned all the straight trees into lumber and toothpicks and paper. And the crooked tree is still there, growing stronger and stranger every day.”
Photography is not about capturing the perfect but embracing the imperfect to see the world differently.

20/08/24, 7:37 am - Dr Raguram: Yesterday was the birthday of one of my favourite poets, Ogden Nash. He wrote a lot of poems about birds and as a birdwatcher, I find his take on the twitchers delightfully playful!
UP FROM THE EGG
“Bird watchers top my honors list.
I aimed to be one, but I missed.
Since I’m both myopic and astigmatic,
My aim turned out to be erratic,
And I, bespectacled and binocular,
Exposed myself to comment jocular.
We don’t need too much birdlore, do we,
To tell a flamingo from a towhee;
Yet I cannot, and never will,
Unless the silly birds stand still. 
And there’s no enlightenment in a tour
Of ornithological literature.
Is yon strange creature a common chickadee,
Or a migrant alouette from Picardy?
You can rush to consult your Nature guide
And inspect the gallery inside,
But a bird in the open never looks
Like its picture in the birdie books –
Or if it once did, it has changed its plumage,
And plunges you back into ignorant gloomage.
That is why I sit here growing old by inches,
Watching a clock instead of finches,
But I sometimes visualize in my gin
The Audubon that I audubin.”

22/08/24, 10:37 am - Dr Raguram: Every time I visit the Bronze Gallery in the Chennai Museum I am totally entranced by the depictions of the dancing Siva in sculptural forms.  Each one of them is so alive, and yet so balanced, so powerful and yet so effortlessly graceful. One can spend hours just looking at their transcendental beauty. It is a difficult task to portray the infinite divine in finite forms. Sankaracharya articulated it perceptively, “O Lord, pardon my three sins: I have in contemplation clothed in form Thyself that hast no form; I have in praise described Thee who dost transcend all qualities; and in visiting shrines I have ignored Thine omnipresence.”
It is indeed an extremely challenging undertaking to portray and convey the manifestation of the Divine in tangible forms, especially the ‘Dance of Shiva’ in his avatar as Nataraja. The primal rhythmic energy of the dancing Shiva found its ultimate expression in the bronzes of the Chola period.  Shiva's dance is set within a flaming halo. The god holds in his upper right hand the damaru (hand drum that made the first sounds of creation). His upper left hand holds agni (the fire that will destroy the universe). With his lower right hand, he makes abhayamudra (the gesture that allays fear). The dwarflike figure being trampled by his right foot represents apasmara purusha (illusion, which leads mankind astray). Shiva's front left hand, pointing to his raised left foot, signifies refuge for the troubled soul. The energy of his dance makes his hair fly to the sides. 
There have been many interpretations of the Dance of Shiva. Ananda Coomaraswamy (who was born on 22nd August in 1877) wrote a brilliant essay detailing it, in the book ‘The Dance of Shiva’, which was published in 1918. He offers a detailed analysis of the five types of dance Shiva does, with extensive and fascinating quotes from mythical literature. Coomaraswamy sees the dance of Shiva as an interplay of Prakriti and Purusha, “The Essential Significance of Shiva’s Dance is threefold: First, it is the image of his Rhythmic Play as the Source of all Movement within the Cosmos, which is Represented by the Arch: Secondly, the Purpose of his Dance is to Release the Countless souls of men from the Snare of Illusion: Thirdly the Place of the Dance, Chidambaram, the Centre of the Universe, is within the Heart. He rises from His rapture, and dancing sends through inert matter pulsing waves of awakening sound, and lo! matter also dances appearing as a glory round about Him. Dancing, He sustains its manifold phenomena. In the fullness of time, still dancing, he destroys all forms and names by fire and gives new rest. By these means, our Father scatters the darkness of illusion (maya), burns the thread of causality (karma}, stamps down evil (mala, anava, avidyfi), showers Grace, and lovingly plunges the soul in the ocean of Bliss (ananda).”
Coomaraswamy concludes by saying, “The image of Shiva as Nataraja is indelibly stitched into the Indian imagination…Whatever the origins of Shiva's dance, it became in time the clearest image of the activity of God which any art or religion can boast of.”
As Thirumular describes in Thirumanthiram;
“The dancing foot, the sound of the tinkling bells, 
The songs that are sung and the varying steps, 
The form assumed by our Dancing Gurupara — 
Find out these within yourself, then shall your fetters fall away.”

25/08/24, 9:11 am - Dr Raguram: Ahalya and myself went for a ‘Tree Walk’ organized by ATREE yesterday morning at Lalbagh. Mr Ganesan with decades of experience gently guided us to identify different tree crown shapes, leaf patterns and details of the trunks, which helps to differentiate the species. ‘Tree Walk’ encourages us to slow down and gaze upwards to unravel how the species have adapted over the years and support a enormous range of birds and insects.  
Lalbagh is home to a vast variety of trees from different parts of the world and it is fascinating to observe their details. There are about fifteen silk cotton trees spread around the garden and I am particularly drawn to a white silk cotton tree near the west gate. It is immensely huge, sprawling majestically across a vast space. The board near the tree informs that it is over two centuries old and it is not clear as to who would have planted it, though the folk lore suggests that it may be Tipu Sultan. To prevent the tree from falling during gusty storms, the tree has huge buttresses which extend for several feet around the trunk. These buttresses are akin to a mother rearing and supporting a child as it grows, develops and matures over the years. Whenever I look at them, I keep wondering about what kinds stories would be hidden within its withered, wrinkled, folds. 
As Herman Hesse wrote in ‘Wanderings; Notes & Sketches’, “Trees are sanctuaries. Whoever knows how to speak to them, whoever knows how to listen to them, can learn the truth. They do not preach learning and precepts, they preach, undeterred by particulars, the ancient law of life.”

26/08/24, 9:14 am - Dr Raguram: Krishna Janmashtami, celebrates the birth of Krishna. Stories of Krishna's childhood are illustrated in numerous paintings and sculptures. This small sculpture at Amrutheshwara temple at Amruthapura in Karnataka depicts an interesting episode during his childhood. 
The village that Krishna lived in, Gokula, was a land of cow herders. Hence, not surprisingly, there was an abundance of milk, curds, and butter in the village. Krishna was very fond of butter and would make use of every opportunity to steal butter from his mother or from any of the place in the village. Many of them started tying pots of butter to the ceiling so that Krishna or his friends couldn’t reach them. Undeterred by this, Krishna would team up with his friends to reach these pots by climbing on the shoulders of his friends.  People found out that Krishna was the prime culprit for these acts and complained to Yashoda. One day, Yashoda lost her patience and tied him up in a heavy grindstone in the courtyard and went inside to attend to her domestic chores. Left alone, Krishna happily and effortlessly dragged the grindstone and passed through the gap between two Arjuna trees. But the grindstone got stuck in between and when Krishna pulled the mortar with all his strength the roots of the two trees get uprooted and they fell to the ground with a loud crash. The twin trees were, in fact, the two sons of Kubera, the god of wealth, Nalakubara and Manigriva. They were cursed by the sage Narada to be born as two Arjuna trees in Gokula. When Krishna pulled down the two trees they got liberated from the curse. 
Since Yashoda tied him to the mortar with a rope, Krishna is also called as Damodara (dam + udara = rope + stomach). Sri Damodarastakam is a poem written by Sri Satyavrata Muni that describes his love for Sri Damodara. The poem is made up of eight verses and is found in the Padma Purana by Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa. In the poem, Satyavrata Muni prays to Sri Damodara to appear to him in his eternal form as a young cowherd-boy and bestow his blessings. The 7th verse states:
कुबेरात्मजौ बद्ध-मूर्त्यैव यद्वत्
त्वया मोचितौ भक्ति-भाजौ कृतौ च
तथा प्रेम-भक्तिं स्वकां मे प्रयच्छ
न मोक्षे ग्रहो मेऽस्ति दामोदरेह ॥ ७॥
O Lord Damodara, in Your form as a baby, Mother Yasoda bound You to a grinding stone with a rope. You then freed the sons of Kuvera, Manigriva and Nalakuvara, who were cursed to stand as trees and You gave them the chance to become Your devotees. Please bless me in this same way. I only long for this and have no desire for any kind of liberation.

27/08/24, 10:27 am - Dr Raguram: Many of us might have grown up savouring every page of Chandamama comics with enchanting tales of mythology, folklore, and adventure. I was recollecting today about one particular story of Krishna and the sparrow.
Kurukshetra was being prepared for the big battle with elephants being used to uproot the trees and clear the space. When one such tree was uprooted, it disturbed a family of sparrows and all of them fell down along with their nest which ensured that they were unharmed. The mother sparrow looked around for some help as she feared that the young ones would be crushed in the ensuing battle. She noticed Krishna and pleaded that he save them all. Krishna responded saying that the law of nature would take its own course, he could not interfere with it and advised that she stock food for the next three weeks. The mother sparrow responded that she trusted Krishna and that the fate of her family rests in his hands and flew away.
When the battle commenced, Krishna asked Arjuna for his bow and arrow and took aim at an elephant. The arrow hit the massive bell around its neck which then fell down. When Krishna told Arjuna that the elephant was the one which brought down the sparrow’s nest, Arjuna wondered why Krishna did not kill it. 
The Pandavas won the ensuing war in which numerous lives were lost. Krishna asked Arjuna to steer the chariot through the battleground which was littered with scores of bodies. He stopped at one place and asked Arjuna to lift an elephant bell which lay on the ground. Arjuna was puzzled as to why Krishna asked him to lift the bell when so many other things needed clearing. When he got down and lifted the bell all the young sparrows flew out with their mother. A single bell brought down by Krishna had saved the lives of the family of sparrows.  
When I read it as a child, I was struck by the fact that Krishna found time amidst the great battle, to save a group of helpless sparrows. Its significance expands when I reflect on it now. We are much like the sparrows caught in the battlefield of life, over which we have little control. It is faith in ourselves and trust in a greater force that often helps us to navigate through the tribulations of life. It is the choices we make which define and guide us.

28/08/24, 7:51 am - Dr Raguram: You cannot miss the Dark Eyed Junco. They have a charm all of their own, with their black hood and unusual metallic chipping song, For the most part, they seem quite content to forage on the ground, kicking up the leaves to garner whatever morsels are hidden below. The flash of their characteristic white outer tail feather is unmistakable when they take to flight. They are quite handsome looking with their black heads and white plumage, like the old saying “dark skies above, snow below.” In some parts of North America, they are strongly associated with winter and are often referred to as snowbirds. 
Junco attracted the attention of poets like William Stafford (17 January 1914 - 28 August 1993). Stafford’s poems are characterized by simple language, unadorned imagery and a conversational tone. He was deeply attached to nature, as he mentioned in one of his works.
“I like to live in the sound of water,
in the feel of mountain air. A sharp
reminder hits me: this world still is alive;
it stretches out there shivering toward its own
creation, and I’m part of it.”
He wrote a small, beautiful poem about the Junco:
“They operate from elsewhere,
some hall in the mountains –
quick visit, gone.
Specialists on branch ends,
craft union. I like their
clean little coveralls.”
Canadian singer Anne Murray wrote a song about it, which won the 1971 Juno Award (the Canadian music award) for Best Produced Single. The song ends with these lines:
“Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know
that I would fly away with you
yah if I could, you know that I would fly away with you.”
There is always an unmeasurable joy in watching birds and reading what the poets say about them!

29/08/24, 8:19 am - Dr Raguram: Eyes, often referred to as the windows to the soul, have captivated artists throughout history. Eyes convey a wide range of emotions powerfully. In any work of art, especially paintings, eyes nudge us to connect with the subjects at an intimate level. In the hands of a skilled artist, eyes capture and convey the individual personality of the subject, with much ease. The gaze of a subject in an artwork can be quite captivating. One such painting which illustrates this is the ‘Laughing Cavalier’, painted by Franz Hal. I haven’t seen this painting in any gallery (so far!). But whenever I see it in the net, I keep wondering whether he is actually laughing or is it a smirk? Is that a mischievous smile we are seeing? His eyes seem to follow us from whichever direction we view the painting. It appears as if he is observing us intently. His gaze engages us in mysterious ways! 
Every time I look at this painting, I am reminded of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s observation that eyes "speak all languages."

30/08/24, 7:06 am - Dr Raguram: An author whom I admire deeply is Oliver Sacks, who eloquently explored the interface between mind and brain in his works. I am captivated by Dr Sacks’ beautiful stories and his loving portrayals of his patients. Referred to as the ‘poet laureate of modern medicine’, he died from ocular cancer on August 30, 2015, at the age of 82. We lead a finite existence and letting go can often be hard. It is an arduous task to negotiate the irreversible trajectory of impending death. 
An anonymous scholar writing in the 15th century wrote a poignant tract on how to prepare oneself for a good death, entitled Ars Moriendi (Latin for ‘the art of dying’). The work instructs as to how one can prepare for their final hours on this earth. It emphasizes the importance of allowing a dying person to experience the emotions they feel without pathologizing those emotions. The possibility of being overwhelmed with existential despair is lessened by allowing a dying person to grieve in their own way, allowing them to focus on the things and people that matter to them most. As the text suggests, most importantly, death is about coming to terms with our transcendental nature. 
After learning of his terminal diagnosis, Sacks reflected on these aspects with remarkable candour which was condensed into a book, ‘Gratitude’. He wrote: 
“Over the last few days, I have been able to see my life as from a great altitude, as a sort of landscape, and with a deepening sense of the connection of all its parts. This does not mean I am finished with life. On the contrary, I feel intensely alive, and I want and hope in the time that remains to deepen my friendships, to say farewell to those I love, to write more, to travel if I have the strength, to achieve new levels of understanding and insight. This will involve audacity, clarity and plain speaking; trying to straighten my accounts with the world. But there will be time, too, for some fun (and even some silliness, as well). ..And now, weak, short of breath, my once-firm muscles melted away by cancer . . . I find my thoughts drifting to the Sabbath, the day of rest, the seventh day of the week, and perhaps the seventh day of one’s life as well, when one can feel that one’s work is done, and one may, in good conscience, rest.”
In these writings, Oliver Sacks reminds us that we are visitors here, passing through the great mystery of life. Every moment of life including the final ones is a gift and one can face death with poise and equanimity.  
In his interesting book, ‘Musicophilia’, Oliver Sacks wrote, “It really is a very odd business that all of us, to varying degrees, have music in our heads.” That music never dies…

30/08/24, 1:43 pm - Nalini N R: A necessary diet for thought. How we live, learn to handle oddities, remind ourselves of the impermanence I think will help in the last moments. It is a practice. Thank you Sir for throwing light on the unknown (for me) authors...

31/08/24, 7:22 am - Dr Raguram: It has been cloudy on most evenings in Bangalore, with an occasional rain drenching the parched earth. Clouds appearing in a vast array of shapes have been fascinating to watch. Slowly the fluffy white clouds give way to dark clouds, foreboding the arrival of rain. Poets and writers feel inspired to use them as metaphors of human emotions ranging from the joyous to the melancholic. Poems about clouds capture their ethereal beauty, ever-changing nature, and their symbolic significance. Shelley’s joyful poem, ‘The Cloud’, starts with the beautiful line, “I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers”.  Wordsworth conveyed a sense of loneliness describing clouds floating over fluttering daffodils in his poem, “I wandered lonely as a cloud.” In Rabindranath Tagore’s words, “Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky.” Mark Strand evocatively described clouds as being “drawn by invisible birds’ and “If a parrot is lost in a cloud, it turns into a rainbow.”
Clouds are moving poetry. As Thich Nhat Hanh commented. “If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this sheet of paper.” 
They teased my imagination too! 
Rainclouds
Caress gently

01/09/24, 11:41 am - Dr Raguram: Gibbons may be the most endangered groups of primates on Earth. Hoolock Gibbon is the only ape species in India. Ahalya and myself were keen to have a glimpse of this rare species and we headed to The Hollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary, a habitat of the endangered Western hoolock gibbon in Assam. After finishing the formalities in the office at the entrance of the sanctuary, we made our way, accompanied by a forest guard. The only way to explore the forest is by walk. The sun was playing hide and seek through the thick trees covered with lush green foliage. As we were walking, we heard an unusual loud call. The guard whispered that it is the call of the gibbon. We walked further for an hour, but couldn’t spot any. Suddenly the guard noticed some activity in the higher reaches of the trees. We stood there for a while, keenly looking for its presence. Slowly a huge, glossy, black figure emerged, hanging from a branch in the tree with its long arm. It swung from one branch to another, adeptly, with sinuous movements. Soon several others joined and they were darting from one tree to another like skilled acrobats. It was so wonderful to watch their graceful movements. With their short torso, long legs, they almost looked like us!
The gibbons are arboreal animals, preferring to stay in the higher reaches of tall Hollong trees. They barely come down to the forest floor. As they are canopy dwellers, it is difficult to have a good look at them. One has to keep craning the neck all the time to spot them. It is also difficult to photograph them amidst the dark green cover. With some effort and lots of luck, I was able to freeze the experience through the lens!
Life is a collection of moments and our tryst with the Hoolock Gibbon was one of the most memorable experience in our sojourns into the wild. As Oscar Wilde commented, “memories are the diary we all carry with us” and our visit to the Hoollongapar Sanctuary will remain as a cherished entry in it. 
(It is so apt to pen these reminiscences on the International Primate Day, especially when the theme this year is “Connecting with Wild Primates.”

02/09/24, 10:41 am - Dr Raguram: We are living in a period in time when differences that separate and divide us have become more salient than commonalities that can bind us together. How should we steer ourselves amidst this unsettling terrain and find some meaning in life? Viktor Frankl (whose death anniversary is today) faced such a dilemma when he was imprisoned in several concentration camps and wrote an inspiring tome, ‘Man’s Search for Meaning’. This book has had an enduring impact in me. Every time I pick up the book I feel inspired by these words, “When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves…we needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.” His advice is quite akin to that of Nietzsche, "He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how”
Frankl was witness to the most horrible suffering that man can inflict on others. In the midst of it all, he noticed that prisoners who had a sense of purpose were more resilient. This informed him that that a resilient, purposeful, proactive attitude is the most important value in life, “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”

03/09/24, 9:11 am - Dr Raguram: One of the spiritual seekers I listened to very early in life, left a lasting impression on me. It was a discourse delivered by Swami Chinmayananda in a playground near our house. I listened in silence to his booming voice as he outlined aspects of the Bhagavat Gita. Much of it was well over my cognitive grasp at that age. But there was an unmistakable pull in the way he addressed the vast audience with clarity and ease.
Much later, I rediscovered him and some of his observations are worth reflecting and I felt like sharing them, on his death anniversary:
“More important than what is behind you and what is ahead of you is what is in you. Seek it. Centred in it, act and live.” 
“To see the one in the many
Is the casual vision of knowledge.
To see the many in the one,
Is the mission wisdom.”
“Be strict and intelligently critical about yourself and your own weakness and follies. But, cushion your words and attitudes with Love. Love is the greatest persuasive power we know in life.”
In throes of adversities in life, I invariably seek succour in these words of his:
“To be patient means to suffer something that hinders or hurts us, and still retain our self-composure. How many difficulties, with their consequent unpleasantness and discord, could be smoothed over and almost entirely eliminated by patience. Patience always elevates and strengthens our character. We need it not only with others but also with ourselves.”

04/09/24, 8:28 am - Dr Raguram: Auroville came into existence when I was doing medicine at JIPMER. I used to cycle there on most weekends to have a look at the emerging settlement which was dotted with very imaginative structures. During one such visit I walked into the ‘Last School’. It was a very unusual, creative building, with no resemblance to any school structure I was familiar with. There was a small stream flowing inside and children were making paper boats and floating them in the water. There was a person who was telling them about boats and how they are carried further in waterways. I was attracted to its imaginative and inventive concept. I came to know that Mother called it the ‘Last School’, to emphasize that once the community took shape, learning would continue outside of formal schools. 
 A couple of years later, I was introduced to the work of Ivan Illich by Prof Moris Carstairs who was a visiting professor at NIMHANS. I reviewed Illich’s ‘Limits to Medicine’, which was chaired by him (I wrote about it two years ago). He urged me to read Illich’s other book, ‘Deschooling Society’. In this most unusual book, he articulated ideas which mapped onto the vision of the Mother. Deschooling is not about abolishing education altogether, but rather about reimagining and restructuring the way we learn. It emphasized the importance of self-directed learning, individual autonomy, and community-based education. To quote Illich, “What is a child, what is a teacher, what is education? Why, in particular, do we tend to think of learning primarily in the context of the school – a particular kind of institution, with a very specific form and organisational structure? What, indeed, are schools actually for? Most learning is not the result of instruction. It is rather the result of unhampered participation in a meaningful setting. Teaching, it is true, may contribute to certain kinds of learning under certain circumstances. But most people acquire most of their knowledge outside school.”
Illich offered a passionate critique of  a formalized, institutionalized educational system and its limitations. It may not be an easy exercise to reshape schools as places of informal, guided, learning habitats focussed on individual skill building. There have been many innovative attempts to create such spaces. The dilemma has always been what happens after such schooling? How do the children from these learning spaces negotiate their lives in the demanding job market outside which is not attuned to such orientations? Many don’t want to be just “another brick in the wall’ and some perhaps find new imaginative paths to explore in their lives.
Unfortunately education has become an industry and there is an urgent need to think creatively about the role and purpose of schools. Illich’s book may be a catalyst in that direction.
As Margaret Mead commented, “Children must be taught how to think, not what to think.”

05/09/24, 7:31 am - Dr Raguram: Teacher’s Day is about paying tribute with an abiding sense of gratitude to teachers who have shaped our journey in learning.
Our formal education starts within the premises of a school. I was fortunate to be a student in the Ramakrishna Mission School, North Branch, Chennai. Among all the teachers who taught us, the one who left a deep impact on me was Sri TS Ranganathan Sir, referred to TSR. He had a commanding presence and when he entered the classroom we were over awed with his demeanor. He was a science teacher but he could also teach us about English literature, geography and human anatomy with ease and élan. He was a polymath. He shared with us anecdotes from forgotten pages of history and opened our minds to explore unknown landscapes of learning. I was learning tennis and one day he called to ask me whether I would like to join him on the tennis court. The school had a tennis court not far away from his home. When I reached the place, I found him dressed in his usual attire, an immaculate panchakacham. Panchakacham is not a regular dhoti and has five pleats delicately tucked in, much akin to a nine yards’ saree worn by women in traditional attire. It took me a while to register that he was going to play tennis in this rather complicated outfit. My reservations were put to rest however when he started to serve. It was a booming service that would be the envy of any seasoned tennis player. I struggled to return it. He didn’t make it easy but egged me on to respond to it. At the end of an hour I was sweating profusely! He patted me and said, “Good start!”. Sometimes he would ask me to tabulate the results of the exam papers in his home and on completion of the task, I would be enthralled listening to him playing the harmonium. 
TSR lit the fire to awaken the joy of learning which was not just confined to the classroom. Borrowing a saying from Robert Frost, he was “not a teacher, but an awakener.”

You can't be a square peg in a round hole. What can be expected from a demand to just vomit what is taught? The learning place is really pathetic and children who are bright start to burn out and get disillusioned.

06/09/24, 8:10 am - Dr Raguram: Mahakuta, an important centre of Chalukya art and architecture is nestled amidst a grove of kadamba trees in a peaceful village, not very far away from Badami. Within the temple complex there are a number of temples, situated around an ancient water tank. Unfortunately, most of the sculptures in the temples have eroded with time. When I walked over to the small Sangameshwara temple, I found a few delicately carved sculptures on its outer wall. The most striking one among them was that of Bhu Varaha. There are three common depictions of Varaha: Bhu Varaha is usually represented standing while that of Pralaya Varaha and Yajna Varaha are in sitting forms. In this stunning sculpture, Bhu Varaha is shown with the head of a boar and the body of a man with four hands. Two hands are holding the shankha and chakra. He is lifting the goddess of earth, Bhudevi, who is safely ensconced in his folded elbow of his left upper hand. The right lower hand rests on his leg. At the bottom are the naga and nagini, with hands folded in devotion. The ornamentation, though delicate, is quite sparse. The graceful, kinetic energy in this depiction has a lasting allure. 
There are several versions of the Varaha legend right from the Shatapatha Brahmana. The most commonly associated legend is that of Varaha lifting the earth, personified as the goddess Bhudevi, out of the cosmic ocean. When the demon Hiranyaksha stole the earth and hid her in the primordial waters, Lord Vishnu appeared as Varaha to rescue her. Varaha slew the demon and retrieved the Earth from the ocean and restored Bhudevi to her place in the universe.
What is interesting is how geological events and processes become part of thos narration. Varaha as an avatar of God Vishnu saved the Earth by lifting it out of the cosmic ocean and restoring it back.   While the legend symbolizes the triumph of good over evil it also emphasizes the need to protect and restore the environment, especially on the background of increasing climate change now. With 70 percent of the planet being covered in water, the oceans are important drivers of the global climate. Increasing greenhouse gases from human activities are altering the oceans before our eyes. Greenhouse gases trap energy from the sun, which the oceans absorb, causing them to warm. As the excessive heat and energy warms the ocean, the change in temperature leads to unparalleled cascading effects, including rise in sea levels. 
Today as our earth faces serious threats from climate change, we should draw inspiration from the legend of Varaha to be proactive in saving the planet.

07/09/24, 7:56 am - Dr Raguram: Nritya Ganapati is the 15th among the 32 forms of Ganesha. This exquisitely carved sculpture of Nritya Ganapati (Dancing Ganesha) is from Chennakeshava temple at Somanathapura. A significant aspect of Nritya Ganapati’s imagery is the setting of his dance, beneath the Kalpavriksha, or the wish-fulfilling tree. This choice of location is not arbitrary. The Kalpavriksha in Hindu mythology is known to grant all wishes. Nritya Ganapati’s dance under this tree thus becomes a metaphor for the joyous and bountiful nature of the cosmos. He is depicted with four hands. His left foot is firmly placed on the ground whereas the right one is lifted up and bent sideways at the knee. He is bejewelled and intricate ornaments decorate various parts of his body. Despite his bulky disposition, there is a lightness in his stance.
Oothukadu Venkata Subba Iyer, popularly known as Venkata Kavi, was a brilliant composer of the 18th Century who made immense contributions to the Carnatic Music repertoire. One of his memorable composition is on Nritya Ganapati, titled ‘Anandha Narthana Ganapathim’ in the raga Naatai, which begins with these lines:
आनन्द नर्तन गणपतिं भावये – (परम् / सदा )
चिदाकार मूलाधार ॐ कार गजवदनं परमम् परम् (आनन्द)
Ananda nartana gaNapatim bhAvayE
chidAkAra mUlAdhAra OmkAra gajavadanam paramam param (Ananda)
I meditate on the joyous dancing Ganapati always
Whose form is pure consciousness, who lives in the muladhara chakra and who is the form of Om, the elephant faced one, the supreme one.
Though we recognize Ganesha in various forms, in Adi Shankara’s words, he is formless Supreme Brahman. 'Ajam Nirvikalpam Niraakaaramekam,' Ganesha is Ajam (unborn), Nirvikalpa (attributeless), Niraakaar (formless) and he symbolizes Brahman, the absolute consciousness.

09/09/24, 10:33 am - Dr Raguram: Literacy is more than just reading and writing. At its simplest, it is a tool for meaningful engagement with society. It shapes and enhances our experience of the world.  
Kerala had 49.5% literacy rate before independence. This has scaled up in the ensuing years and now Kerala has the highest literacy rate among the states of India. Kerala's literacy success can be attributed to a number of factors, including its history, social reform, and the Kerala Education Act of 1958. As of March 2023, the literacy rate in Kerala was 94%. In spite of this remarkable achievement there are pockets where literacy hasn’t made inroads as anticipated. For instance, in Wayanad which has 36 per cent of the state's tribal population, the literacy rate amongst tribals is lower than the district's average literacy rate and the literacy rate of the general population. 
It is on this background that we got involved with the education of tribal children in the region. Wayanad Girijana Seva Trust was initiated by two youngsters who have been committed to this cause and we started working with them. The need was for a secure, hospitable environment where these children could stay and learn. Hence, in the initial phases the focus was on infrastructure, furnished class rooms, hostel, kitchen etc. With the help of volunteers and committed teachers, the educational input has also scaled up over the years. A few years back we added a learning resource centre, fully equipped with laptops to advance their learning.
What I have noticed in the past two decades, is the cascading impact of formal education among the children. Children, especially the girls, have become more assured, confident while keeping alive their tribal identity. Literacy has expanded their ambit of learning and capabilities. 
It has been a journey of learning for us too and there are continuing challenges in maintaining and sustaining the process. We have built bridges of learning for these marginalized children with the fond hope that it kindles the spirit of enquiry to discover and realize the potentials within.
And the spirit flows on…

11/09/24, 10:19 am - Dr Raguram: Mahadevi Varma was one of the four pillars of Chhayavaad, the neo-romantic movement of Hindi literature. She wrote a series of eleven radical essays titled Shrinkhala Ki Kadiyan (Links In My Chain) which is often compared to Beauvoir’s seminal text, ‘The Second Sex’. Married off at an early age, she chose to lead an ascetic life, later on in her life. She was deeply influenced by Buddhism and even wanted to become a monk. There is an interesting anecdote about a particular meeting with her Buddhist guru, when she noticed that he was hiding his face from her with a palm leaf. Shocked by this, she walked out and later said that someone who could not trust himself with a woman had nothing to teach her. 
Mahadevi Varma took an active part in the freedom movement and also wrote eloquently about women’s issues and social reform. A strong believer in gender equality, she was among the first Indian poets to delve into the subject of women rights and their place in society. She powerfully emphasized in her writings, that women deserved every opportunity to flourish in a world that had suppressed their freedom and potential. 
In an essay, ‘अतीत के चलचित्र’ she wrote;
“युगों से पुरुष स्त्री को उसकी शक्ति के लिए नहीं, सहनशक्ति के लिए ही दण्ड देता आ रहा है।”
“For ages, men have been punishing women not for their strength but for their endurance.”
Her works are a living testament to the power of the written word to drive social change.

12/09/24, 8:43 am - Dr Raguram: Mahakavi Bharathiyar was a champion of women’s rights, much like Mahadevi Varma, about whom I had posted yesterday. As a poet, mystic, and visionary, his advocacy of women reached unique heights. His poems, songs, and essays on freedom, feminism, social and gender equality are pertinent to date, despite being written more than a hundred year ago. One of his famous poems is "Pudhumai Penn", which translates to "Modern Woman." It celebrates the empowerment and independence of women. He writes:
நிமிர்ந்த நன்னடை நேர்கொண்ட பார்வையும், 
நிலத்தில் யார்க்கும் அஞ்சாத நெறிகளும், 
திமிர்ந்த ஞானச் செருக்கும் இருப்பதால் 
செம்மை மாதர் திறம்புவ தில்லையாம்;
Her head held high, she walks while looking everyone in the eye
She is a fearless possessor of integrity
She is a proud possessor of wisdom born out of conviction
The resolute woman does not falter or feel inferior
Bharathiyar was a strong advocate of gender parity:
ஆணும் பெண்ணும் நிகரெனக் கொள்வதால்
அறிவி லோங்கி இவ் வையம் தழைக்குமாம்
Recognizing men and women as equals 
Will result in empowered knowledge and sustain the world 
These powerful words are still deeply relevant today and will continue to inspire people to strive for a society that is free from fear, oppression, and discrimination on the basis of gender.

13/09/24, 10:26 am - Dr Raguram: Both Ahalya and myself are in the midst of looking closely at our collection of books and deciding which ones to hold onto and which ones to give away. In the process we discover that it is not as easy as it appears. When I pick up a book, weathered with ages, a flood of memories ensues. Most of the books we have bought are from the iconic ‘Premier Book Shop’. It was our usual haunt in the first week of the moth, once we got our stipends. Shanbhag would lift his head up from a pile of books, greet us and point out to the ones that we should have a look. Now, when I browse those books, making the choice to ‘let them go’ is a daunting task. It is not merely a physical process of giving away the books, but also letting of the memories associated with them. Like the books, emotionally too we cling to myriad stories in our lives, often encompassing resentments, anger and a range of other negative feelings. Letting go is loosening those knots, freeing our energies to flow in the sea of life. It creates newer spaces for fresh beginnings. We have to open the cages of our mind and free the birds that are not meant to be caged. 
As Herman Hesse remarked, “Some of us think holding on makes us strong, but sometimes it is letting go.”

14/09/24, 9:18 am - Dr Raguram: One of the temples not often visited in Khajuraho is the Vamana temple. Set amidst a verdant, green landscape, it is a sight to behold with its spire reaching up like a beautiful mountain. Like rest of the temples in Khajuraho, the outer walls of the sanctum are adorned with intricate carvings depicting scenes from Hindu mythology. In the sanctum is a striking idol of Vamana, the fifth incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Vamana is the first incarnation whem Lord Vishnu appeared in a full human form, as a dwarf.
The legend of the Vamana avatar is narrated in the Rigveda and other scriptures. Mahabali, son of Virochan and grandson of Prahlad, was a generous, mighty monarch who was adored by his subjects.  He was granted the boon of immortality by Lord Brahma and he continued to expand the frontiers of his empire. He conquered all the three realms: Heaven, Earth and the Underworld. Immensely troubled by growing powers, the Devas appealed to Lord Vishnu to intervene and restore the balance of power. Responding to their prayers, Lord Vishnu incarnated as Vamana, the dwarf and went to the Yaga that was being performed by Mahabali. During the Yaga, people could ask Mahabali for and receive anything they wanted. Mahabali bade Vamana to ask for anything that he wanted, like jewels, land, forests etc, without hesitation. Vamana denied all these politely and asked merely for three paces of land. Looking at Vamana’s diminutive stature, Bali said, ‘So be it; pace and take it.’ The dwarf Vamana suddenly grew in size into a giant and with one step measured the Earth and with another the entire Heaven. As there was no room left for the third step that had been granted, Mahabali humbly knelt under Vamana’s foot and offered his head. As Bali sank deep into the underworld, he heard his subjects wailing in grief for their much loved king. Seeing this, Vamana granted Mahabali one last boon. The boon was the permission to visit his subjects on Earth once a year. Thus, Mahabali returns every year to visit his people and the land that he had once ruled. Onam commemorates the annual visit of this legendary king from the underworld to his former kingdom, the land of Kerala. 
Parsva Ekadashi which is observed today is also associated with the legend of Mahabali and Vamana Avatar of Lord Vishnu and is also referred to as Vamana Ekadashi. It is fascinating to note that the Onam festival follows the same legend and takes place around the same time of year.

18/09/24, 7:54 am - Dr Raguram: William Carlos Williams was a full-time practicing physicians who was also a prolific writer across many literary genres. He regarded art and medicine as “two parts of a whole.” Williams rejected traditional conventions of rhyme and meter, masterfully blending colloquial idioms which lent a conversational tone to his poems. Often referred to as the “Master of the glimpse,” Williams painted verbal pictures with crisp, vivid word images in poems like, “The Red Wheelbarrow.” The subject of Williams’s poetry is quite varied; crowds attending baseball games, trains pulling into station, wheelbarrows, fire trucks, and a host of everyday subjects. He drew inspiration from grounded images from any source, in unexpected places.
Even though he was incapacitated by a stroke, he continued to type with his non dominant hand and completed his and Pulitzer Prize-winning “Pictures from Brueghel.”  Additional small strokes resulted in more deficits, but he kept on writing. 
I particularly like his poem “The Fool’s Song”
I tried to put a bird in a cage.
                O fool that I am!
         For the bird was Truth.
Sing merrily, Truth: I tried to put
                 Truth in a cage!
And when I had the bird in the cage,
                 O fool that I am!
          Why, it broke my pretty cage.
Sing merrily, Truth: I tried to put
                  Truth in a cage!
And when the bird was flown from the cage,
                  O fool that I am!
            Why, I had nor bird nor cage.
Sing merrily, Truth: I tried to put
                   Truth in a cage!
             Heigh-ho! Truth in a cage.
Much like the bird in the poem, each of us tussle with some deep secret or truth which we want to hide from others. But truth is hard to reveal and often cannot be hidden. As Leo Tolstoy observed, “Very often, all the activity of the human mind is directed not in revealing the truth, but in hiding the truth.”

21/09/24, 9:53 am - Dr Raguram: As a birder, I am appalled at the sight of birds being confined to cages. Nature had assigned them the open sky and they do not deserve to be in such confined, claustrophobic spaces. When captured and put into cages, these birds become depressed and withdrawn. Their frustration at being restrained often leads to a form of self-mutilation called ‘feather-plucking’. As an Italian proverb states, “The bird in its cage sings not for joy but in rage.” Sometimes we struggle like a caged bird battling enforced isolation in our lives. 
Stevie Smith, a talented, but largely unknown poet, gave expression to these experiences in her poems, like this one titled, ‘The Parrot’. 
“The old sick green parrot
High in a dingy cage
Sick with malevolent rage
Beadily glutted his furious eye
On the old dark
Chimneys of Noel Park
Far from his jungle green
Over the seas he came
To the yellow skies, to the dripping rain,
To the night of his despair
And the pavement of his street
Are shining beneath the lamp
With a beauty that's not for one
Born under a tropic sun
He has croup. His feathered chest
Know no minute of rest
High on his perch he sits
And coughs and spits,
Waiting for death to come.
Pray heaven it won't be long.”
The parrot's helpless rage parallels the poet’s existential angst as she continuously feels caged in her personal life. Stevie Smith lived a largely secluded and celibate life and it was an unceasing saga of illness, abandonment and confinement. Beset with depression, she was preoccupied with the thought of death. The caged parrot is a metaphor for her life constrained by despair and depression, conveying the feeling of death as a release. 
There is always the perennial question whether creativity occurs in spite of illness or because of it. Karl Jaspers in his ‘General Psychopathology’, commented, “Was the morbid event only destructive or was it an ally in positive creation? Many more examples could be quoted and they cannot be subject to a single, common and exhaustive interpretation. But it is certain that some hidden correlation often stood in the background between the fact of illness and the profoundest of human possibilities, between human folly and wisdom."
I also wonder whether in battling her sadness Stevie Smith also draws attention to our confined, isolated urban existence in these times…

22/09/24, 9:22 am - Dr Raguram: Like William Carlos William, Dannie Abse (22 September 1923 - 28 September 2014), was a physician poet. Unlike the former, who largely kept medicine out of his poetry, Abse wanted to “hear the heartbeat of words” and wrote about patients and the diseases they had, with tenderness. Even a stethoscope is infused with poetic insights, transmitting sounds “over young women’s tense abdomens . . . of creation and in a dead man’s chest, the silence before creation began.”
His poem, ‘Portrait of an Old Doctor” begins with these beautiful, reflective lines:
“Lover of music more than his textbooks’
arrythmic prose and dated, almost dangerous
his Conybeare and his Boyd’s Pathology.
(Notes in the margin by the student he was)
What was it all about? Blunderbuss drugs
prescribed to ease the patient. And moonbeams.
A composer—a Beethoven, a Smetana—it seemed, could be deaf, but not a doctor.
He had been a conﬁdence man for the patient.
That’s how it was in the Theatre of Disease
and, at the ﬁnal act, he had lifted
his stethoscope to listen
as if to Mozart.
Then, silently, relatives and friends ﬁled out.
No applause. None for Hippocrates’ art.”
Let me end this post with this poignant poem of Abse
‘Moonbright’
Afterwards, late, walking home from hospital,
that December hour too blatantly moonbright
 - such an unworldly moon so widely round,
an orifice of scintillating arctic light -
I thought how the effrontery of a similar moon,
a Pirandello moon that would make men howl,
would, in future, bring back the eidolon
of you, father, propped high on pillow
your mouth ajar, your nerveless hand in mine.
At home, feeling hollow, I shamelessly wept
- whether for you or myself I do not know.
Tonight a bracing wind makes my eyes cry
while a cloud dociles an impudent moon
that is and was, and is again, and was.
Men become mortal the night their fathers die.”
Lastly, at this stage in my life, these lines from his poem ‘Talking to Myself’ “In the mildew of age/all pavements slope uphill’ touch a deep chord within…

23/09/24, 9:14 am - Dr Raguram: On September 21, Max Schur, Freud’s personal physician visited him and was aghast to see him looking pale and quite wasted.  Freud took his doctor’s hand and said, “My dear Schur, you certainly remember our first talk. You promised me then not to forsake me when the time comes. Now it is nothing but torture and makes no sense anymore.” Schur responded stating that he had not forgotten the promise he made. Freud thanked him and told Schur to “talk it over with Anna, and if she thinks it’s right, make an end of it.” Schur spoke to Anna and she sorrowfully concurred with her father’s wish. Then Schur gave Freud an injection of three centigrams of morphine, a dose much stronger than he would have used if the objective had only been to relieve pain. He was now assisting him to die a peaceful death. He gave Freud another injection that day, then a third on September 22. Freud lapsed into a coma, but he held on to life. At 3AM in the morning on Saturday, September 23, 1939, Sigmund Freud breathed his last. Three days later, his body was cremated and his ashes placed in an ancient Greek urn, originally gifted to him by his friend Marie Bonaparte.
Many years before, Freud had made it abundantly clear as to how he wanted to die as he never wanted to live without his mental capacities intact. He wrote to his friend Oskar Pfister, “With all the resignation before destiny that suits an honest man, I have one wholly secret entreaty: only no invalidism, no paralysis of one’s powers through bodily misery. Let us die in harness, as King Macbeth says.”
Freud left the world with a certain degree of composure. In Nietzsche’s words, “The most fortunate author is one who is able to say as an old man that all he had of life giving, invigorating, uplifting enlightening thoughts and feelings still lives on in his writings, and that he himself is only the gray ash, while the fire has been rescued and carried forth everywhere.”
The last book Freud read was Balzac’s La Peau de Chagrin (The Wild Ass’s Skin). The protagonist, Rapheal de Valentin, gains possession of a wild donkey’s skin and is granted all he wishes. The magical object has the power to fulfil its owner's every wish but carries a heavy price: With every wish the owner's remaining time in life is reduced. On finishing the book, Freud told Schur, “This was the proper book for me to read.”
Mark Edmundson has written a very perceptive book on Freud’s last days, ‘The Death Of Sigmund Freud.’ The book ends with these words “Toward the person who has died we adopt a special attitude: something like admiration for someone who has accomplished a very difficult task.”
In the words of Sheena Blackhall
“It was Saturday, under the sign of Libra
When he crossed, with the aid of morphine,
(that child of Morpheus, Greek God of Dreams)
Into the world of the dead.”

25/09/24, 9:17 am - Dr Raguram: Internet is an immense ocean swirling with humongous amount of information. Sometimes by sheer coincidence an unknown pearl emerges from its depth. A few days ago, I was typing the word luminous in the search box and by mistake typed ‘n’ instead of ‘l’ and a mysterious word ‘numinous’ emerged. Curious to know further I googled about the word and found that it is credited to Rudolf Otto who was an eminent German theologian in the early part of twentieth century. Rudolf is regarded as one of the most influential scholars of comparative religion. He travelled to India twice, mastered Sanskrit and translated many ancient Hindu texts into German.
I also came across an interesting book summarizing his work, ‘India's Religion of Grace and Christianity Compared and Contrasted’ which was dedicated to Sri Krishnaraja Wadiyar. When I was reading the book, I got to know more about his concept of the ‘Numinous’, an experience that, in his view, underlies all spiritual quests. According to him, it has three components, each designated with a Latin phrase: mysterium tremendum et fascinans. As mysterium, the numinous is entirely different from anything we experience in ordinary life. It evokes a reaction of transcendental silence. But the numinous is also a mysterium tremendum. Initially it provokes terror because of its overwhelming power. Finally, the numinous presents itself as fascinans, as merciful and gracious. Rudolf emphasized that it is essentially nonrational, subjective, and cannot be expressed in language. In his opinion, the numinous is a universal aspect of human spirituality and is at the core of all spiritual experience across various cultures and religions. His notion of the numinous remains an important framework for understanding the deeply transformative and awe-inspiring aspects of human spirituality.
I found his concept of ‘Numinous’, quite interesting as it is reflective of the perennial human quest to explore the deeper aspects of individual consciousness and seek its connection to something vast and infinite. For me I often have a glimpse of that state in my sojourns in nature. We only have to lift our accustomed veils to experience it. 
(Rudolf Otto; September 25th 1869 - March 6th 1937)

27/09/24, 9:36 am - Dr Raguram: Kay Ryan, the 16th Poet Laureate of USA has a distinctive, original voice. Her poems are short, not more than twenty lines, some even shorter, replete with intricate wordplay. I found the rich, imaginative nature of her poems quite alluring. She has written several poems about birds and this particular one is permanently installed at the Central Park.
How Birds Sing 
“One is not taxed;
one need not practice;
one simply tips
the throat back
over the spine axis
and asserts the chest.
The wings and the rest
compress a musical
squeeze which floats
a series of notes
upon the breeze.”
There are many entrancing sounds in nature. Listening to the symphonic serenade emerging from the fragile throats of birds is a magical experience. I often immerse myself in that moment, swaying with their haunting, melodic airwaves. In the words of the poet Maria Rainer Rilke, “A birdsong can even for a moment, make the whole world into a sky within us.”

Sharing a poem by Dr Viswanathan Venkatachalam
An interventional cardiologist based in Sydney, Australia
THE INFARCT PARTY 
Today I wish to write a solemn poetry
On poor little coronary artery
With an infarction, it’s lumen totally seals
Gosh! The pain that the patient feels!
In comes the cardiologist from a party
All gadgets to make it hale and hearty
We need to get a catheter in first,
For the clot in the artery to be burst!
In comes the wire and on it a balloon
In saving the life, this really is a boon!
Now the stenosis has just got to vent
In comes to cure the majestic stent!
With all drugs on board is served cocktail
This the happy ending of the cardiac tale!

30/09/24, 8:49 am - Dr Raguram: Today is the birthday of Rumi whose works continue to have a deep impact on me. His poems encompass a rich and complex tapestry of themes and ideas, all deftly woven together. Personally they have been inspiring signposts which gently guided me to discover myself anew. 
Last week I spoke about the travails of the survivors of suicide in a CME. Suicide destroys the fabric of existence of the survivors and their lives become frayed at the edges. Embracing the reality of loss is not an easy task. It is an extremely poignant journey.
In this particular poem, Rumi explores the nature of grief and loss, suggesting that it can be a catalyst for self-discovery and growth. 
“Your grief for what you’ve lost lifts a mirror
up to where you are bravely working.
Expecting the worst, you look, and instead,
here’s the joyful face you’ve been wanting to see.
Your hand opens and closes, and opens and closes.
If it were always a fist or always stretched open,
you would be paralyzed.
Your deepest presence is in every small contracting and expanding,
the two as beautifully balanced 
and coordinated 
as birds' wings.”
Often the survivor’s world becomes constricted in the absence of the person and they withdraw into themselves. Through the evocative use of the metaphor of bird’s wings, Rumi extols the virtue of spreading the wings open, ‘contracting and expanding’ them, to experience the transformative power of loss. 
I have observed in my clinical work that the person whom the survivors think that they have lost, continues to live amidst their own feathers of memory and I strive to urge them to find strength in them, balance themselves and soar again.

In the crowded mayhem of security checks in the airport, one is gently guided ahead of the queue and people offer their seat in the airport shuttle. As they say, “Age is a question of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.” I follow Walt Disney’s dictum “Imagination has no age. And dreams are forever.” 
Thought of sharing a lovely poem by Mary Oliver on the occasion of “International Day for ‘Older’ Persons.”
HALLELUIAH by Mary Oliver
Everyone should be born into this world happy
and loving everything.
But in truth it rarely works that way.
For myself, I have spent my life clamoring toward it.
Halleluiah, anyway I’m not where I started!
And have you too been trudging like that, sometimes
almost forgetting how wondrous the world is
and how miraculously kind some people can be?
And have you too decided that probably nothing important
is ever easy?
Not, say, for the first sixty years.
Halleluiah, I’m sixty now, and even a little more,
and some days I feel I have wings.

03/10/24, 10:53 am - Dr Raguram: Yet another Gandhi Jayanti has passed by with ritual obeisance and hollow homilies uttered by politicians. An epitome of humility, compassion, forgiveness and tolerance, Mahatma Gandhi brought morality into the forefront of political life. There have been very few in public life who have embodied these values. It was my privilege to have met one such person, Sri HS Doreswamy. My first meeting is deeply entrenched in my memory. He was dressed in a simple khadi dhoti and jubba with a towel strung around his neck. Though bent with age, he was deceptively frail looking and the sparkle in his eyes told a different story. After that initial encounter, we met on several occasions. He faced scores of tribulations in life and shared many of the most poignant moments in life freely with me. His innate resilience in the face of hosts of adversities in his life, never dampened his remarkable resolve to serve the people. He was deeply concerned about the malignant influence of money power over the electoral process and the fragmentation of the society across caste and religious divides. 
Sri Doreswamy never held any political position and his power came from his unwavering commitment to social harmony, environmental protection, safeguarding of the constitution and serving the downtrodden.  He led a very simple, spartan life and remarked once that “a social worker should live in voluntary poverty.”
This eminent Gandhian who battled many odds in his life, including Covid infection, died of cardiac problems at the age of 103, a few years ago. 
As a mental health professional I like listening rather than talking. In the process, invariably I tune into the life stories and connect with the heart of people whom I meet. I take a moment today to acknowledge the impact of this special person whose unparalleled resilience and courage of conviction, continues to inspire me.

03/10/24, 10:28 pm - Nalini N R: Thank you Sir for posting Rumi's poems and even I look forward to reading them. It is very true that the loss, grief should enable a person to search deeper meaning of our 'self', progress not succumb. The simile, a very simple mechanical act, when given a second thought holds so much of significance.

Gazing at the sky dappled with myriad colours inspires a sense of wonder. Sometime I imagine myself to be a bird drifting amidst the vast firmament and my imagination takes wings in its metaphorical wings. I wonder whether Flaubert alluded to this when he wrote, "If one always looked at the skies, one would end up with wings." 
Our imagination is boundless and its transcendental power energizes and unfetters us.

On wings afloat

06/10/24, 8:20 am - Dr Raguram: There was quite a heavy downpour in Bengaluru last evening and the meteorologists predicted that more will be on the anvil. Forecasting weather can be quite dicey, even with machine learning techniques which are making steady inroads to predict rainfall, more accurately.
Sometimes an experienced farmer can foresee the onset of rain more accurately than any algorithm. Once we went in search of the most elusive bird in India, the Great Indian Bustard, in the Desert National Park. We got the permission with some difficulty and proceeded to a little village Khuri where we stayed with a farmer in his simple homestay. We spent a night in the midst of the desert with his assistance and it was an experience to cherish. Next morning we were to proceed to the national park. As we were taking leave from the farmer, he looked up in the sky (which incidentally was totally clear), and said, much to our dismay that it will rain in the park area in an hour or two. True to his words, as we neared the national park, it started raining, gathering strength in few minutes. We waited for a while, hoping that it will abate and after some time, rain stopped. But unfortunately we couldn’t enter the park as the tracks inside were muddy and not suitable for the only vehicle that is allowed inside, camel drawn cart, to venture in. Needless to say, it was a huge disappointment. But till this day it amazes me as to how the farmer forecasted the rains so accurately, by just looking at the sky! (I did catch up with the elusive bird, year later and that’s another story!)

08/10/24, 9:10 am - Dr Raguram: Navratri is devoted to the worship of Goddess Durga in her various forms.  Katyayani is one among the Navadurgas, the nine forms of the Goddess, who is worshipped on the sixth fay of Navratri. She is a fierce manifestation of Shakti, the divine female power.
In the Devi Bhagavata Purana, it is mentioned that Rishi Katyayana was a great devotee of Mother Shakti. He wished for the goddess to be born in his household in the form of his daughter. For this, Sage Katyayana did severe penance for years. Meanwhile, the malevolent Mahishasura was wreaking havoc, tormenting the gods relentlessly. Seeking a solution, the divine trinity of Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma emitted flames that coalesced into the formidable form of Goddess Katyayani. Each of them gifted her a weapon to vanquish Mahishasura. She then embarked on a mission, engaged Mahishasura in a fearsome battle, defeated and vanquished him. Hence, she is also referred to as Mahishasura Mardhini.
This delicately sculpted panel in the inner wall of the Chidambaram temple depicts Katyayani with eighteen hands, her leg firmly entrenched on the neck of Mahishasura. 
The legend of Katyayani is not merely a relic of a bygone era but an inspiring metaphor of resilience and empowerment, which women can draw upon in their daily lives even now. In a world beset with discrimination, inequality, and injustice faced by women, her story illustrates that courage, coupled with an unshakable resolve, can be a continuing source of motivation to conquer adversities and challenge norms even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.

09/10/24, 10:13 am - Dr Raguram: This leaf, gnarled and frayed at the edges, will soon plummet gently to the earth at any moment.  It’s limitedness, makes me aware of our own impermanence. As Robert Frost wrote;
“Nature's first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf's a flower;
But only so an hour.
Then leaf subsides to leaf.
So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down to day.
Nothing gold can stay.” 
Impermanence is the essence of life. We build castles on the shifting sands of life hardly realizing their ephemeral nature. It when we recognize the ever changing tides of life, however painful they may be and flow with them, we can truly appreciate the beauty of our temporary existence. In Jimi Hendrix’s words, “Castles made of sand, slip into the sea, eventually.”
Just as this branch will soon release these leaves without resistance, won’t it be wonderful to adapt to the impermanence of our lives with grace?

10/10/24, 10:17 am - Dr Raguram: On this World Mental Health Day, let me draw attention to Dorothea Buck, an inspiring figure who espoused the cause of the mentally ill with extraordinary zeal and commitment. 
When Dorothea was just 19 years old, she was emotionally distraught at the prospect of yet another war and the attendant suffering. She was diagnosed as schizophrenic and was confined to an asylum for nine months where she was subjected to a range of harsh physical treatments. Under the Nazi-era “hereditary health law” protocols, which had been imposed to prevent so-called genetic impurities from being transmitted to future generations, she was also sterilized.  When she was released, she was barred from marrying and denied a career as a teacher. She continued to have periods of psychotic episodes which were poorly treated. Undeterred by these adversities, she started writing about mental health, giving lectures, holding seminars and helping to start organizations to protect the rights of mentally ill persons. 
In her talks and writings, Dorothea continuously emphasized that mental health professionals should provide a safe space and hear the stories of personal suffering, rather than seeing them as soulless objects of study. She drew attention to the importance of a three-way discourse in clinical settings involving the patients, their key relatives and their doctors. She called this process as a “trialogue.”
Dorothea trained herself to be a sculptor and this work of hers is called, “Mother and Child.” Speaking about, it she remarked that such kind of intimate personal relationship between doctors and psychotic patients is “missing in today’s psychiatry… the unrelatedness of psychiatrists to their patients contradicted everything human.”
Dorothea died on Oct. 9, 2019, at the age of 102.
Dorothea’s autobiography “On the Trail of the Morning Star: Psychosis as Self-Discovery”, was originally published in German. Translated into English in 2024, it is available as a free download in Research Gate. It is one of the most moving accounts of her lived experiences and tryst with mental illness and I would urge every mental health professional to read it.
Advocacy about mental health is not merely in the realm of professionals. There is an urgent need to provide spaces, where the voice of people who enter and pas through the gates of immense emotional suffering can be heard.

She is four-armed and carries conch and discus in her upper handd. Her right hand is in ‘abhaya posture’.  She is standing in samabhanga pose, which means she is resting her weight equally on both feet. Vishnu Durga is usually depicted in a peaceful form (Saumya Vadana).

12/10/24, 9:06 am - Dr Raguram: Vijayadashami commemorates the triumph of Lord Rama over Ravana. The Yudh Kanda section of the Ramayana is replete with details of the fierce battle which lasted for nearly seven days. The duel was so intense that both the armies stood watching the ferocious exchanges. Ravana fought valiantly and fired his arrows in the direction of the flagstaff fixed on Rama's chariot. But none of his arrows could reach the Indra's chariot that Rama rode on. All of Ravana's arrows fell to the ground. Rama's arrows, however, tore asunder Ravana's flag-staff which fell and entered the earth. Overcome with rage, Ravana showered a stream of arrows aiming them at the horses that pulled Rama's chariot. But they had no impact on the horses. This enraged Ravana further and he rained a number of objects in the direction of Rama's chariot. That included gadaa (maces), hathora (iron bludgeons), chakras (discs), mountains and uprooted trees, axes etc. When even that failed, Ravana covered the sky with his missiles. Ravana then tried to attack Matali, Indra’s charioteer. This angered Rama and he aimed the arrows at Ravana's heads. The heads fell down one by one, but they grew back.  Finally, Matali, suggested that "To kill Ravana you must use the dreaded arrow of Brahma, given to you by Agastya Muni, which never misses its target". Heeding to his advice, Rama shot the divine arrow, which found its mark and pierced Ravana in the heart, finally killing him.
Amruteshwara Temple in the Chikkamagalur district of Karnataka is embellished with some of the most beautiful carvings of scenes from Ramayana and Mahabharatha. These friezes are quite small in size and showcase the extraordinary skill and craftsmanship of the sculptors. This particular one depicts the battle scene between Rama and Ravana. I have merged two adjacent panels together to form a composite image. The size of the actual panel is as depicted in the photograph!

13/10/24, 11:53 am - Dr Raguram: Migratory birds are a mesmerizing and astonishing aspect of nature that never ceases to amaze me. These remarkable creatures embark on incredible odysseys, spanning thousands of miles annually, between their breeding grounds in the north and wintering grounds in the south. Their epic migrations are a testament to their remarkable adaptations and the formidable obstacles they overcome in an ever-changing world. Their movements are an indispensable part of numerous ecosystems worldwide. 
Ruffs are migratory birds that travel to India from their breeding grounds in northern Europe and Asia. They breed in wetlands and marshes across a vast range that extends from Scandinavia and Russia to eastern Siberia. During the autumn migration, ruffs undertake a long journey, flying southwards to reach their wintering grounds in Africa and South Asia. During their migration, ruffs face a range of threats, including habitat loss and degradation, hunting, and climate change.
Mangalajodi is a magical bird paradise and Ruffs migrate to its wetlands during winter. It is a wonderful sight to see scores of them amidst the marshes and reed beds. Ruffs generally leave India in the months of March and April, as they begin their return journey to their breeding grounds in northern Europe and Asia.
Here is a beautiful poem about migratory birds like Ruff by Nehal;
“These days
My thoughts are like
Migratory birds
Visiting me from
Far far away, unknown regions
Fill the sky of my mind
With their
Beauty, sounds and movements 
of their wings
And when they leave
They leave without a trace
Can't keep them even in my memory
And I start waiting
For
One more winter! 
( 12th October is the World Migratory Day)

14/10/24, 10:16 am - Dr Raguram: José Emilio Pacheco, revered as one of Mexico’s literary giants, deftly wove the rich tapestry of Mexican culture and its landscapes in his works. His poems offer vivid descriptions of Mexico’s diverse ecosystems. These landscapes are not mere settings but are intertwined with his deep reflections about their ecosystem. This particular poem is a living testimony to the transformative power of his words;
INSISTENCE
“Let’s talk about snow once more let’s say
its cardinal virtue is that it’s quiet 
It knows how to be born with impeccable smoothness in the night
and when we wake we see it has claimed
the earth and the trees
The snow is all around you today, where will it go?
The snow that spins interminably around the city
and the house
will take off into thin air
again be cloud and water
then snow once more
You don’t have its easy adaptable nature
You’ll go on and die and be buried
You will be the clod of earth the snow settles on”
When we read a poem like this, we enter the imaginative world of the author. It is a kind of conversation, a sharing of experiences. As Pacheco commented, "I like poetry to be the interior voice, the voice no one hears, the voice of the person reading it. That is how the 'I' becomes 'you', the 'you' becomes 'I', and in the act of reading is born the 'we' that only exists in that intimate, full moment of reading."

15/10/24, 1:23 pm - Dr Raguram: I understand that today is World Students’ Day to commemorate Dr Abdul Kalam’s birthday. He was a great motivator of students and always encouraged them to ask questions in his interactions with them. He also had a website wherein students could raise question on a wide variety of subjects. He even dedicated his book ‘Ignited Minds’ to a class XII student, Snehal Thakkar. According to him, “ a  very important characteristic of a student is to question.”
During our training period in NIMHANS, we were enveloped in an ambiance of open discussion that encouraged questioning. Seminars, case conferences were active crucibles replete with thoughtful and engaging questioning by trainees. On many occasions, these would spill over to the hostel mess for more animated exchanges!
Questioning lies at the heart of active learning. It is like planting seeds of thought. They can create spaces to reflect on new ideas and perceptions. Unfortunately, the trend to question seems to be declining. In many academic presentations across various settings, I invariably notice that students are reticent to ask questions. Is it because as a culture, we overvalue speaking and privilege it over questioning? Or is it because we are educated in a system that implicitly silences questioning and assigns value only to ‘correct answers’? Perhaps teachers and ‘gurus’ feel uneasy being challenged and implicitly discourage questioning?
Historically, the art of questioning was valorised as an important avenue of learning especially in the spiritual realm, across all cultures. For instance, Prashna Upanishad consists of a series philosophical poems presented as questions (prashna) posed by various seekers and responded to by Sage Pippalada. Perhaps it is time to revitalize the ‘Art of Questioning’!
In the words of Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Laureate, “You can tell whether a man is clever by his answers. You can tell whether a man is wise by his questions.”

17/10/24, 11:21 am - Dr Raguram: Valmiki Jayanti commemorates the birth anniversary of the Adi Kavi, Valmiki. The sage’s inspiration to write the epic, Ramayana, is said to have come from a pair of Krauncha birds. One day when the sage was walking towards the river to take a dip, he noticed two birds, a male and female, completely engrossed in each other. Suddenly a hunter emerged from nowhere and killed the male bird.  The female bird was quite distraught and let out a loud cry. Overcome with deep anguish,  Valmiki uttered a shloka, the first ever Sanskrit verse.
मां निषाद प्रतिष्ठां त्वमगमः शाश्वतीः समाः।
यत्क्रौंचमिथुनादेकम् अवधीः काममोहितम्॥
mā niṣāda pratiṣṭhāṁ tvamagamaḥ śāśvatīḥ samāḥ
yat krauñcamithunādekam avadhīḥ kāmamohitam
The verse roughly translates as, “Oh hunter, may you repent for life and suffer, find no rest or fame, for you have killed one of the unsuspecting, devoted and loving krauncha couple.” 
The identity of the kraucnha bird has been a subject of intense debate. It has been variously described as a dove, flamingo, swan, snipe, curlew or a demoiselle crane. The matter was finally settled by Julia Leslie who wrote an interesting paper, “A bird bereaved: The Identity and Significance of Valmiki's Krauncha”. After considering thirty-two species of birds, she established beyond doubt that the bird described by Valmiki was that of a Sarus Crane.   
Sarus Crane is considered as a symbol of eternal love. Emperor Jahangir was very fond of these birds and kept a pair of them which he called, Laila and Majnu!

19/10/24, 12:39 pm - Dr Raguram: Sir Thomas Browne (October 19, 1605 - October 19, 1682), was a physician and philosopher, who wrote on a wide array of subjects, including science, medicine, religion, and the esoteric. One particular work that I personally find fascinating to read is ‘Religio Medici’, a book of his reflections. Translated as "The Religion of a Doctor," it offers an interesting perspective of views on various scientific and religious subjects; “Not picked from the leaves of any author, but bred amongst the weeds and tares of mine own brain.” William Osler, who is credited as "the father of modern medicine," considered ‘Religio Medici’ so influential to his career that he reportedly memorized it by heart. 
I would like to draw attention to two of his reflections that made an impact on me. Cleaving a boundary between the personal attitudes and beliefs and professional responsibilities can often be a daunting task especially in clinical work. Browne urges that there needs to be a clear separation between the spheres of religion and that of science, especially in the field of medicine. He underscores the importance that a doctor must not only tolerate but also respect individual patients' religious beliefs, even if they conflict with his own. Physicians personal, religious beliefs should not impact the way he treats his patients. This stems largely from Browne's own belief that individual churches and sects should not "usurp the gates of heaven, and turn the key against each other; and thus we go to heaven against each other’s' wills, conceits, and, with as much uncharity as arrogance, do err." 
In a period where the moral aspects of medical practice are under strain, Browne draws attention to the fact that a strong moral component is at the core in the practice of medicine. To him, medicine is more than a trade, it is a moral pursuit built on a foundation of service to others. "For by compassion," Browne writes, "we make others' misery our own, and so, by relieving them, we relieve ourselves also." When a disease was beyond Browne's capacity to cure, he felt uneasy and was reluctant to charge the patient any fee, calling this "scarce honest gain." 
“Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle” pondered Alice in Wonderland. Often, our ideas, beliefs and perspectives about life become clear when we introspect and ‘Religio Medici’ is one such example. Sir Thomas Browne is like a person who is sitting on the edge of a stream, looking at his reflection in the ripples of water, plunging himself in the process into the depths of self-introspection, articulating them with clarity and insight in this small book of memoirs.
As Browne observes in this book,  we must “Be able to be alone. Lose not the advantage of solitude. and the society of thyself.” Often the privacy of aloneness provides a space for deep, perceptive reflections.
( When I was typing these lines, my attention was drawn to this small terracotta figure on the desk and I thought that this image adeptly epitomizes Browne’s observations)

21/10/24, 8:20 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir the figure is apt for the write up. But is the medical profession forgetting the humanitarian aspect? The only religion followed is making (minting) money. There is so much of difference between being alone and going inwards compared to feeling lonely...

22/10/24, 8:44 am - Dr Raguram: It has been raining continuously over the past few days in Bangalore and the sun is finally up today. Rains are an abiding source of inspiration for poets. It is used as a metaphor for a wide range of emotions: renewal, cleansing, melancholy amongst others. This particular poem ‘The Rainy Day’ by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was written after the death of his first wife. It is a contemplative poem representing the feelings of sadness and isolation of the poet on a gloomy, rainy day. The sun peeking from behind the clouds offers a glimmer of hope. The poem ends with the evocative line "Into each life some rain must fall”, meaning that anyone of us might feel despondent (some days must be dark and dreary), at some time in our life, but the “the shining sun” will always be around to dispel the dark clouds within.
THE RAINY DAY
The day is cold, and dark, and dreary;
It rains, and the wind is never weary;
The vine still clings to the mouldering wall,
But at every gust the dead leaves fall,
And the day is dark and dreary.

My life is cold, and dark, and dreary;
It rains, and the wind is never weary;
My thoughts still cling to the mouldering past,
But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,
And the days are dark and dreary.

Be still, sad heart, and cease repining;
Behind the clouds is the sun still shining;
Thy fate is the common fate of all,
Into each life some rain must fall,
Some days must be dark and dreary.

23/10/24, 9:06 am - Dr Raguram: Robert Bridges was another physician poet who was also the Poet Laureate of England for over a decade from 1913. He was a conscientious doctor and often found it difficult to use the stethoscope because of the noise in the overcrowded hospital. He described the vivid soundscape of a Victorian hospital ward, poetically: ‘…the rattle of carts in the street, the hum of voices inside, the slamming of doors, the noise of people walking about, the coughings of all kinds, the crying of babies, the scraping of impatient feet, the stamping of cold ones, the chinking of the bottles and zinc tickets, and, after eleven o’clock, the hammering, sawing, and tinkering of the carpenters and blacksmiths who came not unfrequently at that hour to set things generally to rights.” Unfortunately, he contracted a serious lung infection at the age of 38 and retired from the medical profession, immersing himself fully in literary pursuits. 
Bridges had a deep love for all things in nature; “I love all beauteous things, I seek and adore them..” I particularly like his shorter poems, especially this one:
I WOULD BE A BIRD, AND STRAIGHT ON WINGS I ARISE
I would be a bird, and straight on wings I arise
I would be a bird, and straight on wings I arise,
And carry purpose up to the ends of the air:
In calm and storm my sails I feather, and where
By freezing cliffs the unransom'd wreckage lies:
Or, strutting on hot meridian banks, surprise
The silence: over plains in the moonlight bare
I chase my shadow, and perch where no bird dare
In treetops torn by fiercest winds of the skies.

Poor simple birds, foolish birds! then I cry,
Ye pretty pictures of delight, unstir'd
By the only joy of knowing that ye fly;
Ye are not what ye are, but rather, sum'd in a word,
The alphabet of a god's idea, and I
Who master it, I am the only bird.
(Robert Bridges born on 23rd October, 1844)

28/10/24, 8:57 am - Dr Raguram: Just came back after an enthralling sojourn at Ellora and Ajanta. After spending more than two hours savouring the majestic Kailasa temple, we made our way to other caves. Amongst them Cave 10 stands out an enchanting edifice. It is also called The Vishwakarma Cave and is locally known as the Sutar-ka-jhopra (Carpenter's hut). Constructed around 7th century AD, this is the only chaitya in these series of caves in Ellora.
Once we entered the massive cave, we were overwhelmed by its sheer architectural beauty. The apsidal hall is quite long and at the far end of the cave was a huge stupa with a simple circular base, hemispherical dome and a square structure on top. In front of it is a colossal Buddha seated with the Dharmachakra mudra. Dharmachakra mudra holds deep metaphysical significance in Buddhism. It embodies the union of method (Upaya) and wisdom (Prajna), which are essential in pursuing enlightenment. By positioning the hands in front of the heart or the left side of the chest, the mudra signifies teachings emanating directly from Buddha's compassionate heart. A large Bodhi tree is carved at the back and on both sides are the attendants. The outstanding feature of the chaitya is it’s a vaulted roof in which ribs (known as triforium) have been carved in the rock imitating the wooden beams. Even the wooden pins at the joints of beams and lintels have been carefully sculpted in stone.
There was hardly anyone around and the guide asked us to stand with our back aligned to the stone pillars. He then stood in a corned are slowly started chanting, “Buddham Charanam Gachchami” in a soft, low voice. The rhythmic, repetitive chanting reverberated in a magical way in the vast hall and we were immersed in that hypnotizing soundscape. We could feel the vibration of the mellifluous chants cruising through the stone pillars, energizing us. It was not merely a vibrant realm of sacred sounds but a sonic journey that unlocked the doors within.

29/10/24, 8:54 am - Dr Raguram: The first cave one comes across in Ajanta is cave 1. It is not the first one built chronologically and perhaps the last one to be completed. It is the first cave one encounters when approaching the complex from the north side of the horseshoe-shaped cliff. The construction of the cave started around 466 CE and there were several disruptions. Emperor Harisena of the Vakataka  dynasty played a crucial role in executing it.
As we entered the cool, dark interior of the cave, our attention was drawn to the colossal sculpture of the Buddha in the sanctum. He is seated on a throne in the padmasana, with his hands in the Dharmachakra Mudra. Dharmachakra in Sanskrit means the 'Wheel of Dharma'. This mudra symbolizes one of the most important moments in the life of Buddha, the occasion when he delivered his first sermon after his Enlightenment in the Deer Park at Sarnath.
On the left wall adjoining the sanctum is the painting of Padmapani. It is perhaps one of most iconic paintings of Ajanta and has adorned the walls of many houses. I stood in front of it, totally transfixed, devouring as much as I could of its stately elegance. Padmapani, the bearer of the lotus is portrayed holding the flower in his right hand. There is an unbroken flow of the body which is gracefully inclined slightly to the right side. The left-arm is tied with a ribbon. A high crown adorns his head and around his neck is a pearl necklace. There is a long string of jewellery over the left shoulder, falling across the chest. The long, sharp nose, highlighted  with warm colours and inward shading, enhances the serene beauty of his face.
I closed my eyes for a moment and then looked at the deeply introspective, lotus-shaped, half-closed eyes. This is often referred to as the ‘adamantine’ gaze. I wonder whether through his half closed eyes, Padmapani is urging us to withdraw our awareness from the distractions of the outside world and look within, indicating that all the answers we seek are inside us. I was immersed in the overwhelming aura of boundless compassion radiating from Padmapani’s visage and it was difficult to prise myself away from the celestial painting.  As I was leaving the cave, I was reminded of Rumi’s counsel, “Listen with ears of tolerance. See through the eyes of compassion. Speak with the language of love”

30/10/24, 8:51 am - Dr Raguram: In the adjoining wall to the right of the main sanctum in Cave 1 is an interesting painting of Vajrapani, one of the earliest bodhisattvas in Mahayana Buddhism. He is the protector of Buddha and symbolizes the Buddha's power. Padmapani manifests Buddha's compassion and Vajrapani establishes Buddha’s power as well as the power of all five Tathagatas. It is interesting to note tht Indra and Brahmā, are recast as Vajrapaṇi and Padmapaṇi, bearers of the vajra and lotus respectively.
In this painting, Vajrapani is bejewelled, regally attired with an elaborate crown. There is an understated aura of a stately presence. Despite his power, Vajrapani has a peaceful countenance. 
Vajra Vidarana Sutra, explains Vajrapani’s nature thus;
“Condensed within you alone,
Is the power and strength of all the Buddhas.
Manifesting in the form of the enlightened Vajra,
I pay homage to you Vajra Vidarana, the Subduer.”
Vajrapani’s energy is not mere force, not even power in any sense. It is what the Buddhist tradition calls Virya: “energy in pursuit of the good.” Most of this energy remains dormant within us. In Vajrayana meditation, visualizing Vajrapani and chanting the mantra, “Om Vajrapani Hum” ushers a vajra-like enlightened awareness to negotiate the inner and outer fears with a sense of spiritual empowerment.

02/11/24, 8:50 am - Dr Raguram: Balipadyami is observed the day after Diwali in Karnataka. On this day let us recall the story of Mahabali. According to the legend, once upon a time, there was an asura called Bali, also known as Mahabali, who conquered three worlds and was famous for his generosity. Over the course of time he annexed the celestial world too. Unhappy with it, Indra, king of the celestial regions, requested Vishnu to deal with Bali. Vishnu took the form of a dwarf, Vamana, and asked Mahabali for three paces of land. Mahabali granted it without a second thought. The dwarf then suddenly transformed into a giant, and with two paces, he claimed the sky, the earth, and all possessions that Mahabali had. Vamana then asked him where should he take the third step. The only thing Mahabali had left was his body. So he told Vamana to step on his head. Vamana did so and pushed Bali underground into Patal. Mahabali, however, was granted a wish to visit the earth once a year to meet the people who loved him very much.
One of the most beautiful depictions of this myth is in Cave II in Badami: the Vamana-Trivikrama sculpture is carved on the western wall of the mukhamandapa. In the centre of the panel Vishnu is portrayed as Trivikrama. Eight-armed, his right leg is placed firmly on the ground, while the left leg is raised up to the level of chest, with Mahabali underneath it. Of the eight hands, seven hold khadga, bana, gada, chakra, sankha, khetaka and chapa. The remaining left hand is stretched out parallel to the raised leg. A soldier with a sword is shown falling upside down, failing in his attempt to attack Vishnu. A dwarfish person who is portrayed in a royal outfit holds the right leg of Trivikrama firmly, to obstruct his measuring the paces; he is identified as Namuchi, the son of Bali. On the lower left part of this panel, Vamana’s figure has been unfortunately defaced and he can be identified only by his umbrella. Sukracharya is shown by his side pouring water into the hand of Vamana while Bali stands behind with his wife Vindhyavali. Strangely Shukracharya has a Buddha like demeanour. 
What does the story of Balipadyami inform us? Mahabali was caught in the trappings of his ego, craving for more power and perceiving himself as invulnerable. When Trivikrama asked him “where can I place the third step?” he broke free from the fetters of ego and surrendered himself to the divine, cosmic power. When we light the lamp on Balipadyami, let us strive to renew our deeper connection with the divine through transcending the trappings of our ego. It is a path to tread in a period of time when narcissistic patterns are so salient and on the rise. 
Dr Raguram
02/11/24, 10:13 pm - Nalini N R: Today we celebrated Balipadyami. They have sculpted all details so well and clearly though some portions are disfigured. I wonder why Shukracharya is pouring water. As far as I know Bali will pour the arghya (as he was well known for his charity) when Vamana the Brahmana asks for it. His Guru Shukracharya wants to prevent in doing so as he knows who the dwarf is. He will enter the container and block the hole when Vamana takes a blade of grass and pokes due to which he loses an eye. Bali is supposed to have been pushed down as he went against his Guru 's instructions! Thank you Sir for the wonderful sculpture, a treasure we still possess.

04/11/24, 8:31 am - Dr Raguram: One has to take the electric buggy or walks some distance to reach Cave 29. The location of the cave is the most picturesque of all the caves with a large waterfall plunging into the gorge next to it. This cave is planned in the shape of a cross and has massive friezes of Shiva & Parvati adorning the walls. Prominent among them is this large sculptural depiction of the marriage of Shiva and Parvati, officiated by Lord Brahma. Many poets have described this scene in the verse form. I am particularly drawn to this poem titled ‘Mahadev-ji ka Byah’ (Wedding ceremony of Lord Mahadev ) written by Nazeer Akbarabadi.  A Muslim by birth, Nazeer Akbarabadi, predates Ghalib.  He wrote on a wide variety of subjects and on religious subjects ranging from Islam, Hinduism to Budhism.  Nazeer strongly opposed religious orthodoxy and was a strong advocate of the syncretic culture of the land. Here is the wonderful poem about the marriage of Shiva and Parvati. 
“पहले नाँव गणेश का, लीजिए सीस नवाए 
जा से कारज सिद्ध हों, सदा महूरत लाए 
बोल बचन आनंद के, प्रेम, पीत और चाह 
सुन लो यारो, ध्यान धर, महादेव का ब्याह 
जोगी जंगम से सुना, वो भी किया बयान 
और कथा में जो सुना, उस का भी परमाण
सुनने वाले भी रहें हँसी ख़ुशी दिन रैन 
और पढ़ें जो याद कर, उन को भी सुख चैन 
और जिस ने इस ब्याह की, महिमा कही बनाए 
उस के भी हर हाल में, शिव-जी रहें सुहाए 
ख़ुशी रहे दिन रात वो, कभी न हो दिल-गीर 
महिमा उस की भी रहे जिस का नाम 'नज़ीर'” 
“Before you begin, honour Ganesh and bow with grace
so your tasks are completed and good fortune you embrace 
Utter the words of joy, love, affection and attachment
My friends, attentively listen to the story of the wedding of Mahadev
Those who listened from hermits narrated it
And those who listened as the story also certify
Those who listen remain cheerful day and nigh
Those who read and memorize are also happy
Whoever narrates the glory of this wedding
Lord Shiva remains happy with him
This exercise brings the happiness that one doesn’t feel sad
Glory to the narrator whose name is ‘Nazeer’”
Our worldview often becomes restricted by our personal beliefs, religious values and political orientations. The strength of poems like this lies in its ability to transport us beyond these confines especially in times when inclusive principles and pluralistic perspectives are under strain.

06/11/24, 8:14 am - Dr Raguram: Decades ago, in the busy outpatient wing of NIMHANS, I noticed an elderly man who was drumming his hands vigorously on his head. I called him inside and asked him as to why he was doing so. He turned to me and said, “I was listening to music.” It was the first case of musical hallucinations I had ever seen and I reported it as a case study in a journal. There have been many reports of such phenomenon with varied hypotheses as to its causation. It left me wondering as to what would happen if a musician were to have musical hallucinations? Will it be an inspiration, finding its way to his/her musical creations, or will it be a curse?
These questions resonated within me for long, till I chanced upon a wonderful 1958 recording of Robert Schumann’s Symphony No 2, by the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by George Szell. It’s deeply affective sombre opening notes, slowly flow into brighter phase with repartees between strings and winds, ending with a hymn like finale. I must have listened to it many times and was curious to find out more about its composer. I was surprised to read about the inspiration for this symphony. It was a piece of auditory musical hallucination that Schumann experienced. In his words, “For several days, drums and trumpets in the key of C have been sounding in my mind. I have no idea what will come of it”: they found their place in Symphony No 2. 
Schumann battled various physical and psychiatric illnesses all through his life, prominent among them being syphilis. He wrote that his illness, “hearing problems, depression, dizziness, rheumatism is inscribed in the fabric of the piece. I would say that my resistant spirit had a visible influence on it and it is through that that I sought to fight my condition. The first movement is full of this combativeness, is very moody and rebellious in character."
During his final days when he was incarcerated in a mental asylum, he was hearing a musical pitch or an entire orchestra. As his wife recorded in a note, Schumann experienced “very strong and painful auditory disturbances” during this time period. The music sounded in his head, day and night, and sometimes went on for days. 
Though the melodic hallucinations formed a kernel of this inspiring composition, Symphony No 2, Schumann was drowned in a sea of musical hallucinations at the end of his life, probably related to the final stages of the syphilitic infection. That raises a question: Are musical hallucinations a ‘royal road’ to a person’s unconscious creative mind or are they merely discordant notes from a disharmonious brain in disarray?

08/11/24, 9:03 am - Dr Raguram: Sometimes even a desolate landscape can kindle the creative spirit in a poet. An example is this poem, “No Birds in Sight, The Forest Withers Slowly” by Ivan Bunin. Ivan was the first Russian author to be awarded the Nobel Prize in 1930. He wrote this poem when he was just 19 years old.
NO BIRDS IN SIGHT, THE FOREST WITHERS SLOWLY
No birds in sight. The forest withers slowly,
Resigned to utter emptiness and chill.
No mushrooms, but there comes from out a gully
Of mushroom damp the strong and tangy smell.

The  scrub is lighter and less tall, the greying
Grass near the bushes droops, seems trampled down;
Beneath the autumn  rain the leaves, decaying,
In mouldy  heaps lie of a darkish brown.

But in the fields the wind is fresh and biting.
I lead my stallion out and ride from home,
And, in the freedom of the steppe delighting,
Far from the villages till nightfall roam.

Lulled by my mount's slow, easy pace, I listen
With joy-tinged, quiet sadness to the hum
Of wind as it invades with singsong whistle
And drawn-out moan the barrels of my gun.
As the poet makes his way through the forest, he is surrounded by barren trees that have shed their foliage. There an overwhelming silence as the woods are shorn of bird calls. The mouldering leaves form a crumbling pile on the moist undergrowth of the woods. There is a touch of melancholic beauty around him. Absence of any human or animal activity around him enhances his perceived isolation. But as he rides with his mount across the landscape the wind serenading through the trees buoys up his spirit.
The inner and outer landscape merge and blend seamlessly in this enchanting little poem. As Thoreau reflected, “Am I not partly leaves and vegetable mounds myself?”

11/11/24, 9:17 am - Dr Raguram: Banteay Srei is a small temple near Angkor Thom in Cambodia and is considered to be the “jewel of Khmer art.” Exquisitely carved in the mid-10th century, it is the first temple in Angkor to depict mythological scenes, each one of them superbly carved.
This particular panel depicts the story of Lord Krishna slaying Kamsa. Kamsa was the tyrannical ruler who took over the kingdom of Mathura after overthrowing his father, Ugrasena.  Narada Muni had prophesized that Kamsa’s sister Devaki's eighth child would kill him. Kamsa imprisoned Devaki and Vasudev, and killed seven of the children that Devaki gave birth. When the eighth child, Lord Krishna was born, Vasudev took the child out of the prison safely to Gokul, his friend Nanda’s home. Nanda’s wife Yashoda had also given birth to a girl and Vasudev took the girl child back to the prison. When Kamsa came to know about the birth, he rushed to the prison and tried to kill the baby. But the baby slipped from his hand and was transformed into the goddess Yogamaya, who told Kamsa: “O foolish! What will you get by killing me? Your nemesis is already born somewhere else.” After hearing that Lord Krishna was alive, Kamsa sent many Rakshas to kill him but they all met their demise. Frustrated with this, he came up with a masterplan to kill his nephew in his kingdom. He announced a wrestling match with demon brothers Mushtika and Chanura. Hearing of this, Lord Krishna went over to Mathura with Balarama. When they reached the arena, Kamsa ridiculed them and sent the demon brothers to the arena. After a fierce fight, Lord Krishna and Balrama slew the wrestler demons. Seeing this and filled with rage, Kamsa stormed to the arena himself. Lord Krishna grabbed him, threw him down on the ground and beheaded Kamsa.
The final battle between Lord Krishna and Kamsa is depicted with much detail in this particular panel in Banteay Srei. The event takes place in Kamsa’s beautifully carved palace. Large number of women witness the event and one can notice the agitation on their faces. At the bottom of the panel, Lord Krishna and Balarama arrive at the palace in their horse drawn carriage. The entire episode is intricately sculpted with much attention to detail.
Kamsa Vadh is celebrated today in Mathura, primarily by the Chaturvedi community. On the next day of Kamsa Vadh, ‘Teen Van Parikrama’ is performed in Braj region. It covers three towns namely Mathura, Vrindavan and Garun Govind. It is believed that Lord Krishna performed this Parikrama to absolve the sins of killing Kamsa.

19/11/24, 9:40 am - Dr Raguram: One of the major factor impacting access to and utilisation of mental health services is stigma. Overcome with shame and isolation, people with mental illness feel discriminated from the rest. It has a cascading effect on their social relationships, wellbeing and quality of life. 
Erving Goffman was perhaps the first sociologist to dwell into it in his book, ‘Stigma, Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity.’ According to him, stigma essentially conveys a devalued stereotype, an “attribute that is deeply discrediting.” The discredited attributes can include race, religion, ethnicity, physical deformity and mental illnesses. Stigmatized people feel stigmatized in relation to a group of people who are deemed to be normal, and normal people consider themselves normal in relation to people who viewed as less than normal and stigmatized. According to him stigma exists in a relationship between an attribute and frames of understanding and society which views that attribute as representative of a deviance from social norms. In his words, “By definition, of course, we believe the person with a stigma is not quite human. On this assumption we exercise varieties of discrimination, through which we effectively, if unthinkingly, reduce his life chances. We construct a stigma-theory, an ideology to explain his inferiority.” 
I was wondering whether there is a biographical context to Goffman’s explorations into aspects of stigma. Was it the anti-Semitic discrimination which he experienced early in his life as an immigrant Jew or his lived experience of tending to his life who had a lifelong mental illness and died by suicide.
Perhaps much of our efforts to understand human behaviour and the social world around us often emerges from our own personal experiences.

20/11/24, 9:01 am - Dr Raguram: Ajanta has a series of Buddhist caves. As I step into one of its dark interiors, silence enveloped me like a comforting blanket. In the vast cavernous space, I felt alive, with the soft breeze from the valley below caressing me. At the far end of the cave was a striking sculpture of Buddha, softly lit; its beauty accentuated by a colourful painting in the ceiling.  When I continued to gaze on the Buddha, the sounds from the transitory world outside slowly faded away and I was transported into an inexplicably serene realm. It was a strange feeling and quite indescribable too. 
As I made my way outside of the dark cave, my heart was filled with an ineffable light.

26/11/24, 9:14 am - Dr Raguram: Trees are being felled at alarming rate in Bengaluru. The iconic tree lined avenues have faded away, and linger only in memory. Sometimes what we glimpse through eyes can find their way through a poet’s heart and find expression in haunting words, like in this poem ‘The Poplar Field’ by William Cowper.
“The Poplars are fell’d, farewell to the shade
And the whispering sound of the cool colonnade
The winds play no longer and sing in the leaves,
Nor Ouse on his bosom their image receives.
Twelve years have elapsed since I last took a view
Of my favourite field and the bank where they grew,
And now in the grass behold they are laid,
And the tree is my seat that once lent me a shade.
The black-bird has fled to another retreat
Where the hazels afford him a screen from the heat,
And the scene where his melody charm’d me before,
Resounds with his sweet-flowing ditty no more.
My fugitive years are all hasting away,
And I must e’er long lie as lowly as they,
With a turf on my breast and a stone at my head
E’er another such grove shall arise in its stead.
’Tis a sight to engage me if anything can
To muse on the perishing pleasures of Man;
Though his life be a dream, his enjoyments, I see,
Have a Being less durable even than he” 
The poet describes the destruction of a field of poplar trees which no longer offer him shade. The birds too have flown away. Reflecting on the passage of time, the poet wonders with a touch of melancholy, whether he too will return to earth soon. The degradation of the outer landscape and its liminality is symbolic of the tribulations that Cowper went through all his life. His life was one long tryst with pain as he suffered from recurrent attacks of severe depression, “lying down in horror, and rising up in despair” resulting in several suicidal attempts. He found succour in the company of John Milton who wrote the ‘Amazing Grace’. 
Cowper died from dropsy on April 25th 1800. He summed up his life in these words;
“I, who scribble rhyme
To catch the triflers of the time,
And tell them truths divine and clear
Which, couched in prose, they would not hear.”

29/11/24, 9:37 am - Dr Raguram: Elephants are magical. Their footprints are deeply imprinted in the cultural, collective consciousness and in individual memories of each one of us.
Mythical stories narrated in the Purāṇas mention that the weight of the world rested on divine elephants. Hence not surprisingly, the giant pachyderms figure prominently in temple architecture all around the country. In Hindu temples, they are found primarily in the Adhisthana, the base of the structure on which the superstructure of the temple rests and on Upapitha (sub-base or plinth) of the shrine. 
There are two ways in which elephants figure in these structures. Gajapitha, consists of a row of standing elephants holding the pitha. The most wonderful example is in the Kailasa temple at Ellora. Rising from the middle of the rock-cut courtyard, the monolithic temple conveys the impression of being borne aloft on the backs of dozens of life-sized elephants. Beautifully sculpted from the black basalt, they seem to hold the temple up with consummate ease. Though many of them have borne the vagaries of time, there is an unmistakable grace and power in them. (Photograph on top is from Kailasa temple).
A different way in which elephants figure in temple structure is that of Gajathara. It consists of a horizontal frieze of elephants, generally in the lowermost portion of the Adhisthana. The adhisthana usually comprises a remarkable array of horizontal bands depicting at the base, a row of elephants, symbolizing stability. Over this, scrollwork containing delicately carved figures of birds, animals and mythical animals and over these another row of miniature pillars, with a row of miniature temple vimanas. At the highest level are figures of dancers and musicians. The whole adhisthana enclosing the temple is thus transformed into a gallery of intricate sculptural art with miniature carving at its best. The elephants in the bottom layer are usually rendered in profile, marching in procession or in war and hunting scenes. An outstanding example is in the Hoysala temples, especially in Belur and Halebid. (Glimpses of this in the bottom photo from Halebid)
The symbolism of the elephant in Hindu mythology and temple architecture encompasses wisdom, dignity and strength. Its portrayal in these sculptural forms reflects these qualities while also serving as a reminder for us to strive for these virtues in our own lives.

30/11/24, 9:01 am - Dr Raguram: Often writers choose pseudonyms in their writings, to conceal their true identities and they use them for a variety of reasons. For instance, Isaac Asimov used the fictitious name of Paul French to publish a series of science fiction books early in his career. Fernando Pessoa, the famous Portuguese writer ventured in the opposite direction, using heteronyms. In his own words, “A pseudonymous work is, except for the name with which it is signed, the work of an author writing as himself; a heteronymic work is by an author writing outside his own personality: it is the work of a complete individuality made up by him, just as the utterances of some character in a drama would be…  I break my soul into pieces, and into different persons.” More than 72 heteronyms have been identified in Fernando Pessoa’s writing! Sometimes he even thought that, at times, he could see and hear the heteronyms he had created. 
Basically a heteronym is an imaginary character created by a writer to write in a different style. The writer becomes a virtual subject, who starts inhabiting the character's life first-personally. As a consequence, the characters in heteronym have their own individual identity, which is expressed in writing.  Viewed this way I was wondering whether heteronym is a precursor to Avatar!
Pessoa’s famous work is the ‘Book of Disquiet’ which has an unusual structure. It is totally nonlinear and a fusion of poetry and prose in which the author reflects on various aspects of life. In an interesting comment, the author states, “My soul is a hidden orchestra; I know not what instruments, what fiddlestrings and harps, drums and tamboura I sound and clash inside myself. All I hear is the symphony.”

02/12/24, 9:34 am - Dr Raguram: ‘Come to the Edge’ is a poem often attributed to Guillaume Apollinaire but actually written by poet, activist, Christopher Logue (23rd November 1926 – 2nd December 2011). Whenever I read this poem, a series of images and meanings keep swirling through my mind. Quite often we feel contented, settling into our own comfort zones. Life is often a delicate dance between the possible and the impossible. Logue urges us to venture further and discover uncharted territories that we feel hesitant to explore. 
Years ago I went along with my friend to explore the caves in the Antaragange hill near Kolar. It was the first time I attempted to climb a hill. The guide reassured me that it shouldn’t be too difficult. Encouraged by his reassurance I started the climb. The first few ascents were a bit difficult but when we entered the caves on the top, the cool morning breeze was quite refreshing. The difficulty started when I started to climb down. I felt that the rocks might give way and was overcome with intense fear that I would tumble down the hill. It was at that time, the guide came over and whispered in my ears, “Doctor, the mountain is in the mind.” I felt energized by that comment and made my way down with much greater ease. The dreadful consequences I had anticipated vanished into thin air. Crossing the threshold of fear opened my mind to lurking possibilities within. To this day, these words resonate deeply within and swell to contain the anxiety whenever I face uncertainties in life. 
Often the most profound experiences lie beyond the familiar and have a way of keeping us afloat.
COME TO THE EDGE
Come to the edge.
We might fall.
Come to the edge.
It's too high!
COME TO THE EDGE!
And they came,
and he pushed,
And they flew.

04/12/24, 9:34 am - Dr Raguram: Kandariya Mahadeva Temple is the largest and most ornate temple at Khajuraho. Every inch of its exterior walls is adorned with a mesmerizing profusion of sculptures. Deities from the Hindu pantheon like Brahma, Vishnu, and Ganesha grace the walls, their expressions radiating serenity and power. Geometric patterns and floral motifs add a touch of elegance, while friezes depicting scenes from mythology offer a glimpse into ancient Hindu epics. Interspersed with these are the celestial nymphs (apsaras) in their flowing attire adorned with intricate jewellery. They are shown in various poses, such as playing instruments, dancing, beautifying themselves, or removing a thorn from the foot. 
I was totally bewitched on seeing the depiction of a voluptuous apsara with a scorpion sculpted on her left thigh. Intricately carved, it seems to be traveling up. It doesn’t appear to be a decorative motif and seemed to be associated uniquely with the celestial beauty. Strangely, there is no fear or apprehension on the apsara’s face.  What could be the association of a sensuous beauty with a scorpion? In Indian mythology, Vrischika has multiple and diverse symbolic meanings, ranging from fear to allure. In Vedic astrology Vruschika Rashi embodies intensity, passion, and transformation. Could the scorpion be a metaphor for female arousal? Al-Biruni, in his book written in 1029 A.D. just around the time that the Kandariya Mahadeva temple was constructed and shortly after his own trip to India, states that in India, scorpions were associated with the genitals, fertility, progeny.
I searched far and wide to understand and unravel the iconographic background of the association of scorpion with sensuality and it still remains an unfathomable mystery to me!

05/12/24, 9:41 am - Dr Raguram: Yesterday was the World Wildlife Conservation Day. It is celebrated to raise awareness about the importance of protecting the earth's endangered species and ecosystems. It’s main aim is to encourage people to conserve wildlife and their natural habitats.
Vultures figure prominently among the endangered species in India. Though they play a crucial role in the ecosystem, they are one step away from total extinction. In an earlier post, I had drawn attention to the silent, committed work by Sri Bharathidasan and his colleagues at Arulagam, an environmental organization based in Coimbatore.  Bharathi and his colleagues have been working actively over the past decade to protect and increase the critically endangered vulture population in Tamil Nadu. They educate the local communities through awareness campaigns about the importance of vultures in the ecosystem, advocating for the elimination of harmful veterinary drugs that are poisoning vulture food sources. 
When we went along with them in the Satyamangalam Tiger Reserve recently, we sighted around 120 white-rumped, long-billed, and red-headed vultures. More than sighting a large flock, it was the age group of vultures that was remarkable; there were juveniles, sub adults and adults, many of them perched on trees. Bharathi was moved by the sight as it was the first time that such large number of vultures were sighted in Tamil Nadu.
India, owes much of its natural splendour to the selfless efforts of group of remarkable individuals like Bharathi and his dedicated team. These unsung heroes have dedicated their lives to the cause of protecting and preserving the nation's precious wildlife like vultures. Their efforts are a living testimony that it is feasible to transform potential conflicts into collaborative solutions ensuring the conservation of precious species in the ecosystem.
As Margaret Mead commented, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.”

06/12/24, 7:46 am - Dr Raguram: Rumi is not merely a poet; he is also a spiritual guide. I dip into his works often and the ‘doors of perception’ start opening. If I have to choose just one poem to illustrate this, it is this one. 
“Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing,
there is a field. I’ll meet you there.
When the soul lies down in that grass,
the world is too full to talk about.
Ideas, language, even the phrase “each other”
doesn’t make any sense.
The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you.
Don’t go back to sleep.
You must ask for what you really want.
Don’t go back to sleep.
People are going back and forth across the doorsill
where the two worlds touch.
The door is round and open.
Don’t go back to sleep.”
Often we get enmeshed in binaries in our lives: good/bad, right/wrong, proper/improper, valid/invalid etc. Such a position often results in a judgmental stance and we start viewing the world around us through these prisms. Basically a sense of duality shapes our worldviews. Rumi wonders whether there is a realm of experience beyond this. Is it possible for us to be in a more unified space where we can aspire to free ourselves and savour a more unified reality? In that mind space void of labels and judgements, duality dissolves and we can realize our ‘oneness’. 
Thanks to Rumi, whenever I find myself quick to judge, I pause and reflect.

09/12/24, 9:50 am - Dr Raguram: Despite being an acclaimed poet in Persian, Sadi Shirraj or Sa’di, felt that he had written nothing of consequence and resolved to spend rest of his life in silence. One day, he broke his vow at the insistence of his close friend when both of them went for a stroll in the garden. Sadi noticed that that his friend was gathering rose petals and putting them into his robes. Sadi wondered why his friend was collecting and storing them carefully when they would dry very soon and will not be of much use. He told his friend that, instead, he would write a book called the Gulistan, (Garden of Roses), whose folios would last forever. The Gulistan remains one of the most beloved works of Persian literature. It consists of parables interspersed with short poems. In one of his most beautiful poems in the book, he wrote; 
“Human beings are members of a whole
In creation of one essence and soul
If one member is afflicted with pain
Other members uneasy will remain
If you have no sympathy for human pain
The name of human you cannot retain”
The flowers of Gulistan's poems are still fresh today and can be savoured in a wonderful translation by Richard Burton.

10/12/24, 9:47 am - Dr Raguram: I just finished reading a deeply moving book, “Why do you fear my way so much?” by GN Saibaba. He was 90% paralysed and had spent over 10 years in jail, till the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court acquitted him of all charges. Saibaba died on October 12, 2024.
This particular passage from the book is heart rendering;
“I have lived all my conscious life on the campuses of learning and teaching in search of knowledge, love and freedom. In the course of this search, I learnt that freedom for a few was no freedom. I began to study histories, philosophies and literatures with more eagerness and critical engagement. That led me to look around myself closely. I travelled across and met people living in sub-human conditions. I realised that they never tasted freedom very much like me. I understood that castes and freedom can never co-exist. I began to speak to myself. Then I slowly started to speak to my fellow beings on my journey. I grasped of a great void of silence around me. I saw a society of silence. I dashed myself against the boulders of silence. I brutally wounded myself”….
“I reel under excruciating relentless pain. One after the other, my organs started bursting. The closure of my voice within me explodes into shooting pain. My vocal chords acquired lesions making my voice a thin and inaudible squeak. My heart broke with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. My brain has started having blackouts with a condition called syncope. My kidneys are silted with pebbles; my gallbladder gathered stones and pancreas grew a tail of pain called pancreatitis. Nerve lines in my left shoulder broke under the conditions of my arrest, known as brachial plexopathy. More and more organs of silence replaced the original. I have been living with explosive and shooting pain day in and day out. I am living on the margins of life.” 
And he quotes a verse from Faiz Ahmad Faiz
“My pain, a voiceless song,
my being a nameless mote.
If only my pain could speak,
I’d know who I am.
And if myself could find its essence,
I’d unravel the mystery of this world.
If I could seize this hidden mystery,
my silence would find expression.”

13/12/24, 9:40 am - Dr Raguram: Separation is a poignant theme across all creative oeuvres. It encompasses a range of emotions involving intense longing as well extreme sadness. The anguish and emotional turmoil of separation is particularly well expressed in the realm of poetry. Often described as ‘viraha’, where lovers experience intense pain due to physical separation, evocative descriptions are aplenty in works like Kalidasa's ‘Meghaduta’, Jayadeva's ‘Gitagovinda’ and in Tamil Sangam poetry. In the latter, where different landscapes are associated with specific emotions, separation is described on the background of ‘neithal’, where the separation of lovers is associated with the vastness and loneliness of the sea and in exquisite detail in the ‘paalai’ landscape which symbolizes complete separation and the harshness in a desolate, barren environment.  
The torment of separation plays out powerfully in the palette of Expressionist painters like Edvard Munch (12 December 1863 - 23 January 1944), who is often remembered for his iconic painting ‘The Scream’. In a painting titled ‘Separation’ he portrayed a man and a woman in the process of parting. Our eyes are drawn to the striking colour contrast between the two.  The man, ostensibly overwhelmed with emotions of sadness and despair is painted in black. On the other hand, the woman is painted with a brighter yellow colour, symbolic of happiness and optimism.  While the man is static, the woman seems as though she is ready to move on from him and cross the black line of separation. While the man is still caught in the web of the past, suffering from the memories of what they once had together, the woman looks far across the line, awaiting the future. What is also interesting is that the man’s right hand is painted with the colours of the woman, indicating how the man fails to let go of the woman from his heart which seems to be bleeding. Colours are not merely aesthetic choices in art; they hold the power to evoke powerful feelings. Edvard Munch utilizes intense hues as a powerful tool in this painting to convey emotional tribulations lurking within the individuals in throes of separation, so effectively. 
Only Pablo Neruda can voice these in verse, 
“..Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.
To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.
And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.
What does it matter that my love could not keep her.
The night is shattered and she is not with me.
This is all…”

16/12/24, 9:48 am - Dr Raguram: Confronting mortality is not an easy task. Very few musicians have ventured into this landscape and prominent among them is Mahler. He explored the vicissitudes of life and death in his masterly Second Symphony. It is a work that explores mortality and inevitably of death and ends with an affirmation of a transcendent, everlasting life. The first eight lines from the final movement were taken from the poem, ‘Die Auferstehung’, by Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock and Mahler wrote the rest himself; 
“Rise again, yes, rise again,
Will you, my dust, after a brief rest!
Immortal life! Immortal life
Will he who called you, give you.
You are sown to bloom again!
The lord of the harvest goes
And gathers sheaves,
Us, who have died.
O believe, my heart, O believe:
Nothing is lost to you!
Yours, yes yours, is what you desired
Yours, what you have loved
What you have fought for!
O believe,
You were not born for nothing!
Have not lived for nothing,
Nor suffered!
What was created
Must perish;
What perished, rise again!
Cease from trembling!
Prepare yourself to live!
O Pain, you piercer of all things,
From you, I have been wrested!
O Death, you conqueror of all things,
Now, are you conquered!
With wings which I have won for myself,
In love’s fierce striving,
I shall soar upwards
To the light which no eye has penetrated!
I shall die in order to live.
Rise again, yes, rise again,
Will you, my heart, in an instant!
That for which you suffered,
To God shall it carry you!”

17/12/24, 8:27 am - Dr Raguram: I first came across the name of Kirkbride in a book tantalizingly titled, “Madhouses, Mad doctors and Madmen.” Kirkbride (July 31, 1809 - December 16,1883), was one of the thirteen founders of the Association of Medical Superintendents of American Asylums for the Insane (now the American Psychiatric Association), and was its president from 1862 to 1870. He was a passionate advocate of ‘moral treatment’ of the insane and argued that the place where the mentally ill are placed, must further this cause. Towards this end he spent considerable amount of time to develop an architectural plan for these buildings which is often referred to as a the ‘Kirkbride Plan.’
When I had a look at the ‘Kirkbride Plan’ I was struck by its similarity to wings of a bird! From the central administrative block two wings extend out in a staggered fashion. The idea behind was that the living quarters of the patients should have maximum light and ventilation, with high ceilings. Each ward would be a self-contained unit with all facilities under one roof. Kirkbride paid meticulous attention to each aspect of the design, including the design and placement of the windows, plan of the bathrooms and even recommending particular building materials and colours of paint. He specially emphasized that the living quarters should open into large outdoor landscape and foliage, so that all the patients could be part of it. Patients were segregated by their condition; those who were quite disturbed were kept in the pavilions furthest from the centre. 
‘Kirkbride Plan’ was adopted in several asylums in US. Except for a few which have been declared as heritage structures, the rest have been pulled down and demolished in the era of deinstitutionalization. 
Even though no mental hospitals are being built now, ‘Kirkbride Plan’ is a remarkable document from a certain time in history of care of the mentally ill, which emphasizes the important role of architecture in facilitating a healing environment.

18/12/24, 9:07 am - Dr Raguram: It is a sight to behold when the majestic purple heron takes to the sky. It may look somewhat gawky when perched on the ground, but it is such winsome bird in flight, looking so effortless as its wings languidly rise and fall with those long legs trailing behind.
Mary Oliver is a favourite poet of mine. She effortlessly captures the most tranquil moments in nature and weaves them in words, like in this poem;
HERON RISES FROM THE DARK, SUMMER POND
“So heavy
is the long-necked, long-bodied heron,
always it is a surprise
when her smoke-colored wings
open
and she turns
from the thick water,
from the black sticks
of the summer pond,
and slowly
rises into the air
and is gone.
Then, not for the first or the last time,
I take the deep breath
of happiness, and I think
how unlikely it is
that death is a hole in the ground,
how improbable
that ascension is not possible,
though everything seems so inert, so nailed
back into itself —
the muskrat and his lumpy lodge,
the turtle,
the fallen gate.
And especially it is wonderful
that the summers are long
and the ponds so dark and so many,
and therefore it isn’t a miracle
but the common thing,
this decision,
this trailing of the long legs in the water,
this opening up of the heavy body
into a new life: see how the sudden
gray-blue sheets of her wings
strive toward the wind; see how the clasp of nothing
takes her in.”
At one level the poem is a vivid description of a heron taking flight. For me, the metaphor in the poem is one of ‘Being and Becoming.’ From ‘being’ in the dark pond of life, there is always an innate transformative quest in us to ‘becoming’ one with the vast “clasp of nothing.”

19/12/24, 8:19 am - Dr Raguram: Emotions come through stronger in black and white photography and touches the heart of the viewer. The greatest example of it is in the works of TS Satyan. Almost all his works are in exquisite shades of black and white wherein the light gently caresses the subjects. He freezes the moment with loving subtlety and images linger on in our memory.
I was privileged and deeply touched when he gifted some of his photographs, which I treasure and value profoundly. Fondly recollecting my memorable association with this legendary lens man on his 101st birthday.

20/12/24, 9:29 am - Dr Raguram: Cintio Vitier was a Cuban poet, essayist, and novelist, often referred to as "one of the most important writers of his generation". His abundant love of the ordinary people and his firm conviction that without roots in those people, nothing can be created, finds expression in his poems. He wrote, “Soul of the nation lived in the quiet suffering of the poor or middle-class family, in its capacity for resistance and hope, in its irrepressible popular laugh, in its unbeatable music, in the lamp of the intellectual, in poetry.” 
“My words verge on silence
like great birds that disappear
into the early evening: their
strenuous white wings
carry off the intense sweetness
of dusk, visible then
in starlight.
My words turn toward the night
with no look back
at what is lost or won, or
what is missing, like those workers,
who, utterly fatigued
by a long day, return home
so the household once again can rest
and the strength that comes
with morning be restored.”
Here, the poet wonderfully transposes the metaphor of the birds with that of workers who toil tirelessly. I always feel that there are birds lurking within us, resting and finding a moment to recoup the strength to fly again and again in the vast sky of life.

06/01/25, 8:19 am - Dr Raguram: 5th January is celebrated as National Bird Day in USA. Every time when we are there, we manage to do some bit of birding. Last year we visited Lake Placid, which is nestled in the heart of New York state's scenic Adirondack Mountains. One morning when I was sitting on the deck, I heard a very unusual bird call. It was like a guttural squeak, ending with a long whistle. Curious to locate it, I saw a bird sitting on the tree ahead which was emitting the call. It had a glossy-iridescent body, with purplish-blue head, neck and breast. Its eyes were like intense little black beads that seemed to look at me sideways. Quickly I searched the net and found that it was a grackle. I sat for a while observing it closely as it was joined by scores of its ilk, it was sheer grackophony!
Once I was back in the room, I was curious to know whether this bird has caught the attention of poets. In a short poem published in 1958, Lisel Mueller described what I witnessed a few minutes ago.
“Watching the black grackle
come out of the gray shade
into the sun, I am dazzled
by an unexpected sheen,
yellow, purple, and green,
where the comb of light silkens
unspectacular wings —
until he, unaware
of what he means at this one
peculiar angle of sun,
hops back to his modest dark
and leaves the shining part
of himself behind, as though
brightness must outgrow
its fluttering worldly dress
and enter the mind outright
as vision, as pure light.” 
When the poets dips their pen in ornithology, the results can be quite enchanting!

10/01/25, 11:24 am - Dr Raguram: The Padma Purana narrates the history of Vaikunta Ekadasi through the episode of the asura Muran, who secures Vishnu’s blessings but abuses his power. Vishnu Himself engages him in a combat. When Vishnu rests briefly in a cave, the asura tries to ambush Him at which point, a female form springs from Vishnu’s chest and kills Muran on the 11th day of Margazhi sukla paksham. Vishnu names her as Ekadasi. She seeks Moksha for Muran and anyone who prays to Vishnu on this day. It is believed that Vishnu opens the north gate of heaven, Vaikunta vaasal for those who pray to him on this day. Vaishnavite temples replicate this practice by opening the Sorga Vaasal.
Lord Vishnu has five states. Param, Vyuham, Vibhavam, Antaryami and Archam. The first state Param is the state known as Paramapadam, Vaikuntam or Moksam, which is located in a space beyond all worlds. This is a sculptural depiction of Para-Vasudeva from cave 3 at Badami. He is shown here with four arms, seating on Sheshanaga (serpent), also known as Ananta, who symbolises primordial principle of time. Vishnu is seated on the coils of Ananta, in a relaxed manner with his left leg folded over the coils and right leg resting down. His upper two hands hold shankha and chakra while his lower-right hand is placed on the coils and lower-left hand rests on the left leg. The five hoods of Ananta serve as a parasol over his head. The sculpture is exquisitely carved with fine ornamentation and eye for detail.

13/01/25, 8:12 am - Dr Raguram: Music and dance are not merely aesthetic forms but also serve as conduits for realizing the divine presence. For instance, Arudra Darisanam which is observed today, celebrates the cosmic dance of Lord Shiva as Nataraja. Nataraja’s dance is not just a physical expression but signifies the underlying vibrations that sustain the universe, embodying creation, preservation, destruction, release, and embodiment, often referred to as Panchakrityas.
One of the beautiful expression of Nataraja’s dance is in the form of Alidhanrita Shiva. This sculpture is from Kailasanathar Kovil in Kancheepuram. Here he is depicted in a Swastika Mudra. On the right side is Parvathi with an adoring expression relishing the dance, with a Nandi below her. On the left is a musician playing the drums. The animated Shiva Ganas are dancing with sheer abandon at the bottom. Right on top is a small, exquisitely carved Ganesha. 
Kaviyogi Sri Suddhananda Bharathi composed a beautiful song about the dancing Shiva, ‘தூக்கிய திருவடி' “tUkkiya tiruvaDi’ in raga Shankarabharanam. He pays obeisance to the Lord in the opening line;
“தூக்கிய திருவடி துணை என நம்பினேன் துரிய நடராஜனே” 
“I seek salvation in your raised foot, Oh Supreme Lord, Nataraja.”
This particular verse in Thevaram by Tirunavukkarasar, beautifully articulates our abiding quest for salvation from the Lord;
மனமெனுந் தோணி பற்றி
மதியெனுங் கோலை யூன்றிச்
சினமெனுஞ் சரக்கை ஏற்றிச்
செறிகட லோடும் போது
மதனெனும் பாறை தாக்கி
மறியும்போ து அறிய வொண்ணா(து)
உனையுனும் உணர்வை நல்காய்
ஒற்றியூ ருடைய கோவே.

At that time, deliver me from my veil of ignorance and grant me salvation, Oh Lord."
13/01/25, 11:22 pm - Nalini N R: The sculpture is so beautiful, vivid. Even the dainty fingers in the dancing posture are sculpted so carefully. Thank you Sir for translating the verse which explains the life of mortals. The baggage carried in the mind shakes the intellect and the worst part when it is destroyed by the desire.

16/01/25, 8:51 am - Dr Raguram: There is something ineffable when I see a vibrant flower, glowing in the morning sun. Rhododendron is not an uncommon flower; there are more than six hundred varieties of it. But sometimes it’s gorgeousness holds my attention as I immerse and lose myself amidst layers of its elegant petals.
One day when Ralph Waldo Emerson took a stroll in the woods, he was drawn by the exquisite beauty of the flower and wrote a lovely poem, ‘The Rhodora’.
“In May, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes,
I found the fresh Rhodora in the woods,
Spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook,
To please the desert and the sluggish brook.
The purple petals fallen in the pool
Made the black water with their beauty gay;
Here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool,
And court the flower that cheapens his array.
Rhodora! if the sages ask thee why
This charm is wasted on the earth and sky,
Tell them, dear, that, if eyes were made for seeing,
Then beauty is its own excuse for Being;
Why thou wert there, O rival of the rose!
I never thought to ask; I never knew;
But in my simple ignorance suppose
The self-same power that brought me there, brought you.”
We might often wonder what purpose this flower serves in the garden when no one notices its beauty. The poet answers succinctly;
“Tell them, dear, that, if eyes were made for seeing,
Then beauty is its own excuse for Being;”
Philosophical tomes vary in their interpretation of what constitutes beauty. To me it is merely a transcendental experience. Something that is felt deeply within the echelons of the heart which communicates with the spirit of the natural world. In the poet’s words;
“The self-same power that brought me there, brought you.”
As John Ruskin observed, “Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty.”

17/01/25, 9:37 am - Dr Raguram: Every time I read a poem by Mary Oliver, I feel a deeper connection with nature. In spite of a difficult early life, she had an abiding passion for nature and began writing at an early age.  Influenced by both Whitman and Thoreau, she was an ardent observer of the natural world. Many of her poems are grounded in her experiences and interactions with animals, plants, and the landscapes which she explored all through her life. In her work, she invites us to slow down, pay attention, and savour the beauty of the natural world. An avid walker, she once commented, “For me the door to the woods is the door to the temple.” Her integration with nature comes alive in a lively poem, ‘Sleeping in the forest’
“I slept as never before,
a stone on the riverbed, nothing
between me and the white fire of the stars
but my thoughts, and they floated
light as moths among the branches
of the perfect trees.”
On her death anniversary today, let me recall these poignant words of her;
“When it's over, I want to say all my life
I was a bride married to amazement.
I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms.”

19/01/25, 8:33 am - Dr Raguram: Tulips are native to Central Asia, particularly the mountainous regions of Turkey. They were introduced to the Netherlands in the 15th century from the Ottoman Empire and the flower has been a Dutch icon ever since. In the 17th century, tulips became so valuable that they caused a craze known as "tulip mania". People traded valuables and paid huge amount of money for tulips. It is often cited as an example of greed, excess, with the prices of flower bulbs reaching extraordinary heights fuelled by crowd psychology. Unfortunately, the bubble burst, leading to what historians now call the first economic bubble in history. 
In Persian folklore, the first tulip is said to have bloomed from the blood of star crossed lovers, Farhad and Shirin, in a tale reminiscent of the infamous Romeo and Juliet. The first recorded mention of the tulip in human history comes from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam;
“As then the Tulip for her morning sup
Of Heav'nly Vintage from the soil looks up,
 Do you devoutly do the like, till Heav'n
To Earth invert you—like an empty Cup.” 
The 13th-century Persian poet Saadi Shirazi often referenced tulips in his writings.;
“Perhaps the tulip know the fickleness
Of Fortune's smile, for on her stalk's green shaft
She bears a wine cup through the wilderness.” 
Poet Allameh Muhammad Iqbal, urged to “create poetry from the silence of tulips and roses,” and wrote;
“My heart is restless, 
Like the west wind in a field of tulips. 
The moment my eyes light upon a pretty face, 
My heart begins to long for one prettier still.”
The genus Tulipa comprises around 75 species, each contributing to the tulip’s rich tapestry of forms and colours. This particular one I saw in Filoli Historic Garden in San Francisco is called ‘Lady Tulip.’
(The start of tulip season is celebrated during the third saturday in January in Netherlands as the ‘National Tulip Day’. This year it was dedicated to Amsterdam’s 750th anniversary. )

20/01/25, 9:21 am - Dr Raguram: Disability is often associated with the wheelchair. in 2004 Annie Hopkins who was physically impaired, created the “wheelchair heart symbol” while she was an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois. Annie felt that by replacing the wheel with a heart, the stigma associated with the wheelchair will also be removed. She considered it is a symbol of society accepting people with disabilities as equals and a symbol that people with disabilities accept their challenges and embrace them, whole heartedly. Her slogan was 3E; “Embrace diversity. Educate your community. Empower each other.” 
Annie passed away at a young age in 2009 and her legacy is kept alive by celebrating January 20th as the ‘International Day of Acceptance.’ 
Unfortunately, the reality on the ground in India is an unsettling one. In spite of legal provisions about the rights of persons with disabilities, they continue to face discrimination. The disabled are the invisible citizens of India. The state has failed them. Even access to common facilities is a distant dream. Lack of mobility continues to be a major barrier and it becomes very difficult for people with disabilities to navigate due sparse ramps in public places. 
Any one of us can become disabled at any point in our lives and at that moment what we’ll seek is some form of acceptance by the society around us, which often can prove to be elusive. Few years ago, a bright young medical graduate sought my help. When he was young, his right hand had to be amputated when he tried to retrieve a kite from the power line. Undeterred by it, he learnt to write and perform actions of everyday life with his left hand. Though he secured a very high rank in CET examinations for post graduate courses, he was denied the opportunity as he was considered physically unfit to pursue postgraduate studies. He pleaded with the authorities that he will choose a discipline which doesn’t involve use of his right hand, but all his pleas fell on deaf years. He was devastated. Recouping from it, he wrote the competitive exams to go to US and not surprisingly scored very well. Once he went to US, he did his psychiatry residency and now occupies an important position in one of the committees of the American Psychiatric Society. He took inspiration from Stephen Hawking, who observed, "My advice to other disabled people would be, concentrate on things your disability doesn't prevent you doing well, and don't regret the things it interferes with. Don't be disabled in spirit."

26/01/25, 9:27 am - Dr Raguram: Plato’s ‘Republic’ is perhaps the most important philosophical work dating back to thousands of years. In it, I am particularly drawn to the passages from the ‘Allegory of the Cave.’  It challenges us to question our perceptions and seek truth beyond appearances. 
The story is told as a dialogue between philosophers Glaucon and Socrates, as narrated by Socrates. A group of prisoners live in a cave. A bright fire is burning inside prevents them from escaping. They spend their time watching a series of people they can't see as projected shadows in the wall in front of them. Since they have lived there since early childhood, they believe this to be their world. However, one prisoner manages to escape, and somebody drags another one and they come out into the real world. Once they escape the Cave, they are upset because their eyes burn in the overwhelming sunlight. But eventually, their eyes adjust, and they see the world for what it is, a new reality. They feel that if they try to go back into the Cave to rescue other prisoners, they would not be able to do it as their eyes, having adjusted to the sunlight, would not be able to see in the darkness of the Cave. 
Plato points out that our senses can often be deceiving, and what we perceive as reality might only be the shadows of the true world. Though stepping out of the cave and gaining new knowledge can be initially painful and disorienting, it opens up new avenues which facilitate deeper understanding beyond what appears on the surface.  Plato urges us to push the boundaries of knowledge and expand its realms. It is a powerful and enduring metaphor to live by.  
Plato's Allegory of the Cave is so relevant now, providing us a compelling analogy, and warning, of the dangers of social media. It highlights how social media can create a distorted sense of reality, reinforce existing biases, influence us through external forces, lead to addiction, and disconnect individuals from reality.

27/01/25, 10:53 am - Dr Raguram: I was listening to Mozart’s Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major (K448). It’s interlocking melodies had an inexplicable soothing effect on me. Curious to find out more about the impact of listening to it, I searched the net and came across “the Mozart effect”. It refers to the observation that people notice brief,10-15 minutes, improvements in visual-spatial reasoning after listening to it. So impressed with this finding, in 1998, Georgia governor Zell Miller launched a program to distribute classical music CDs to every new-born in his state. 
The moot question is whether the noticed impact is solely due to this particular composition of Mozart. Researchers have noticed that other types of music, including rock music, can produce similar results. So the effect seemed to depend on the kind of music that has a particular emotional impact and not on listening to Mozart’s sonata specifically. 
On the other hand, there is growing evidence for the efficacy of Mozart’s Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major (K448), at reducing ictal and interictal epileptiform activity, especially in those with refractory seizures. This is often referred to as Mozart K448 effect. Little is known about the mechanism underlying this beneficial for persons with epilepsy. Nevertheless, that Mozart can bring relief to refractory epilepsy patients must be music to their ears!

29/01/25, 9:02 am - Dr Raguram: Anton Chekhov, incorporated themes related to psychiatry into many of his works, particularly in War No. 6". It is a remarkable and thought-provoking short story.
Dr Ragin is the medical superintendent of a hospital in a small provincial town. Though he is a compassionate, caring physician, he finds himself unable to effect any meaningful changes in the system and is quite disillusioned. He starts talking to Gromov a patient in the section of the hospital which for the mentally ill.  Gromov, challenges many of Ragin’s views, “You're conversant with reality only in theory. And why is it you despise suffering, why don't you ever feel surprise?” Gromov himself was labelled as being mentally ill and incarcerated due to his outspoken views about society and he astutely observes “sanity is a precious illusion, a fragile membrane between us and the void.”
As Ragin starts spending more and more time with Gromov, authorities start suspecting his sanity and he is advised to go on vacation. On his return, he finds himself marginalized in the hospital and starts isolating himself. The changes in his behaviour convince the authorities that Gromov has himself become insane and he is forcefully committed as the sixth patient in the ward for psychiatric patients. Unable to bear this, he attempts to escape and is beaten by an attendant. He dies the next day.
Chekhov deftly explores the boundaries between sanity and insanity and questions the validity of the practices employed within the healthcare system to label as mental illness, behaviours which do not conform to the expectations and standards of the society. Chekhov narrates with much sensitivity the isolation, despair and the sense of alienation faced by the patients in Ward 6, “the walls of Ward No. 6 are not made of bricks, but of despair and forgotten dreams…. Its  walls speak volumes, if only we would listen.”
It is a sombre tale of the travails of the human psyche. It is not merely a critique of institutionalization and the dehumanization experienced by patients in the mental health care system but also a poignant examination of the depths of human suffering. It raises important philosophical questions about the nature of reality, the meaning of life, and the inherent loneliness and suffering that individuals grapple with at some time in their lives.
As Chekhov writes, “We are all inmates of our own minds, forever locked in the prison of our thoughts…in the darkest corners of our minds, madness lurks, waiting to claim us.”

01/02/25, 7:07 pm - Dr Raguram: In her budget proposals today, the FM announced the formation of a Nuclear Energy Mission with an outlay of Rs 20,000 crore on the background of continuing concerns about the safety of nuclear energy. 
Hiroshima opened our eyes to the enduring impact of the nuclear fallout. One of the most incisive accounts about the aftermath of the horrific event is a small book of essays ‘Hiroshima Notes’, by the Nobel Laureate Kenzaburo Oe. Prior to his visit to Hiroshima, Oe had a son who was born with brain hernia and he had great difficulty in coming to terms with it. However, his perspective about his son underwent a significant transformation after the visit. The astonishing bravery of the Hibakusha, atomic bomb survivors filled him with shame about his own attitude to his son. When the agonized victims had every reason to commit suicide but did not, when the doctors had every reason to give up but never faltered in trying to heal and comfort their patients, how could he deny the travails of his very own son?
Hikari, his son, had severe deficits and was mostly unresponsive to events around him. One day, much to the astonishment of the parents, he began responding to the sound of a wild bird’s call coming from the television. They bought a recording of wild birds’ calls, and played it in the room throughout the day. Eventually, Hikari learned to remember these bird calls and call out their names too. Encouraged by this, his mother started playing music by Mozart, Beethoven and noticed that Hikari had an intense interest in listening to them. The parents arranged for a piano teacher, and instead of speaking, Ōe began to express his feelings in music and learnt to transfer those chords through writing in spite of difficulties in hand eye coordination. Slowly, over time, Hikari started composing music in his head, without a piano, at the age of 13, drawing upon the vast array of notes stored in the depths of his memory. He composed a piece for a school event at age 18 and started performing in small concerts. He released his first album, “Music of Hikari Ōe”, when he was just 29. The album sold over a million copies and won Japan's top prize for classical Japanese music. He became famous even before his father won the Nobel Prize. Today, Hikari is Japan’s most famous savant composer. He can recognize and recall any piece of music he has ever heard and transcribe it from memory. It is a remarkable example of artistic expression despite overwhelming deficits and handicaps. 
Kenzaburo chose to commit himself to cherish and nurture a brain-damaged son. This choice replenished him, giving him new power and creative direction and even a sort of spiritual meaning for a confirmed agnostic. “I felt I was reborn,” he remarked, “If we can live through our difficulties, we can find a new dimension in life.”

02/02/25, 10:40 am - Dr Raguram: Today is Vasant Panchami, the most picturesque season which lends itself to beautiful descriptions across varied literary genres. It is a symbol of hope and fresh start. In ‘Ritusamhara’, Kalidasa writes, 
"Oh, dear, in Vasanta, Spring, trees are with flowers and waters are with lotuses, hence the breezes are agreeably fragrant with the fragrance of those flowers, thereby the eventides are comfortable and even the daytimes are pleasant with those fragrant breezes.”
There is a wonderful shabad ‘Dekh Phool Phool Phool’ by Guru Arjan Dev in Raag Basant on Ang 1185 of Sri Guru Granth Sahib. The literal translation is ‘Look, the flowers are blooming,’ but the deeper meaning is about observing the transformative power of nature and applying that concept to one's own spiritual growth. It is a call to appreciate the divine presence in all creation, especially through the imagery of blooming flowers symbolizing the flourishing of inner beauty.  
“Behold the flowers flowering, and the blossoms blossoming forth!
Renounce and abandon your egotism.
Grasp hold of His Lotus Feet.
You meet with God, O blessed one.
O my mind, remain conscious of the Waheguru Almighty.
The tender young plants smell so good, while others remain like dry wood.
The season of spring has come; it blossoms forth luxuriantly.
Now, the Dark Age of Kali Yuga has come. 
Plant the seed of Waheguru’s Naam, the Name of the One Lord. 
It is not the season to plant other seeds. 
Do not wander lost in doubt and delusion. 
One finds Waheguru the Almighty with Guru’s help
O mortal, this is the season of the Naam. 
Nanak utters the Glorious Praises of the Lord Waheguru.”

03/02/25, 7:20 pm - Dr Raguram: Norman Rockwell (3 February 1894 - 8 November 1978), is considered by many to be one of America's greatest artists. He was a master storyteller via canvas and paint and created more than 300 covers for The Saturday Evening Post. One day we made our way through the scenic Berkshire countryside to the Norman Rockwell museum which is situated in Stockbridge. It is set in a beautiful 36-acre site overlooking the Housatonic River Valley. Norman Rockwell's home and studio are also located in the museum grounds. The museum houses the world’s largest collection of Rockwell’s works, including more than five hundred of his original paintings. 
As I was walking through its carefully curated collections, I was drawn to one particular painting, ‘The Triple Self Portrait’.  Self-portraitures are the original selfies! It captures a version of how the artist sees himself/herself. As Frieda Kahlo observed, “I paint myself because, I am so often alone, because I am the person I know best.” The master of self-portrait Rembrandt, painted hundreds of his own images on canvas. Artists often paint themselves by looking at the mirror. Hence you don’t see their hands, only their faces on the canvas.
Rockwell’s self-portrait is different. There are three Rockwells in the painting. One is seated at the easel with his back to the viewer. The other is the painted image of himself as seen in the mirror and then there is a drawing of him in the canvas. It is essentially Rockwell painting a portrait of himself painting a portrait of him painting a portrait of himself painting a portrait of him. Actually there are more! When I looked carefully at the top left hand side of the canvas there are least four drawings of himself! Each one of these self-portraits seem to have a distinctive individuality of their own. In the process, the artist is also paying tribute to some masters of self-portraiture like Rembrandt, Vincent van Gogh and Picasso whose faces are seen on the right edge of the easel. 
I personally feel that through this intricate composition Rockwell seems to draw attention to the dynamic nature of identity. The truth is that all of us have multiple identities, within a single self. We all have many identities, some fixed and some fluid, that help us make sense of ourselves and our experiences in the world. As Walt Whitman articulated beautifully, “I am large, I contain multitudes.”
(Incidentally this image is a photograph I took while watching the ‘The Triple Self Portrait.’)

09/02/25, 5:55 pm - Dr Raguram: In the place where we stay, we hardly hear the loud, harsh, repetitive "caw" sound of the crows. Its place has been taken over by the prolonged ‘cooing’ sound of hordes of common pigeons. There could be many reasons for the seemingly declining population of crows in Indian cities. Even though crows seem to be rather scarce, they have made their presence in the works of many creative artists. Recalling two of them…
Mahakavi Bharathiyar sought the formless divine presence in the shining plumage of the crow in his poem “Kaakai Siraginile." It is one of his most beautiful poem; 
காக்கைச்  சிறகினிலே நந்தலாலா-நின்றன் 
கரியநிறந் தோன்றுதையே நந்தலாலா
“In the shining dark feather of a crow I see your radiant presence, Nandalala."
RK Laxman whose death anniversary is today, was besotted with crows. They were the subjects of some of his most wonderful drawings. He declared that crows were far more intelligent than human beings. In his words, " I am also very fond of crows and have painted hundreds of them – singly and in groups. I have been fascinated with the crow from my childhood. I like its colours and how it contrasts with everything. It is a very intelligent bird and has tremendous character; in fact, the common crow is a very uncommon bird. As a child, crow attracted me more than any other bird because it was alive on the landscape."
Both of them have flown away, but the crows linger on in their works for us to cherish.

12/02/25, 10:37 am - Dr Raguram: This majestic sculpture of Subrahmanya is at the Kudimiyamalai temple in Pudukottai district. The twelve handed Lord is shown seated with his left leg folded, on a peacock. The right hand is depicted in Abhaya Mudra and the left hand in Varada Mudra. The Makara Thoranam encircling the beautifully carved sculpture is adorned with a Kirti Mukha on top.
The word ‘Subrahmanya’ itself means the One who originated from ‘Brahman’ in joy and is inseparable from the Bliss of the ultimate Reality. He is the effulgence of Brahma. Adi Shankara composed ‘Subrahmanya Bhujangam’ in praise of the Lord;
मयूराधिरूढं महावाक्यगूढं
मनोहारिदेहं महच्चित्तगेहम् ।
महीदेवदेवं महावेदभावं
महादेवबालं भजे लोकपालम् ॥३॥
Salutations to Sri Subrahmanya mounted on a peacock representing the deepest Secret of the Upanishadic Maha Vakyas,
Whose beautiful body dwells within the great heart of divine Consciousness,
Who is the great god of the devas and conveys great Vedas,
I worship that son of Mahadeva, who is the Protector of the World.
Subrahmanya is worshipped by different names, like Skanda, Kartikeya, Subrahmanya, Sanat Kumara, Swami, Muragan, Shanmukha or Arumugha, Swaminatha, Guru Guha and so on. He is worshiped as the king of serpents, too. His worship waned over time in northern India where he is regarded primarily as Kartikeya and Murugan eventually found his way back into the Tamil heartland, where he began his journey as Seyon many centuries ago during the Sangam era. During this period, the land was classified into five types, according to its primary geographical feature or tinais. These were Mullai (forest land), Marutham (agricultural land), Neithal (coastal land), Paalai (dry, arid land), and Kurinji (hilly land). Each of them was associated with a guardian god who and it was Seyon (or Murugan) in Kurinchi. The earliest poem of the Sangam Age, Thirumurugatrupadai, is dedicated to the glory of Murugan, . The momentum was sustained by Arunagirinathar, who composed Thiruppugal, Devaraya Swamigal who penned the popular hymn Kanda Sasthi Kavasam and many other savants. 
Thai Pusam was celebrated with much fervour yesterday in Tamil Nadu, especially in Thiruchendur, where the final battle between Murugan and the demon king Surapadman is said to have taken place. Armed with a mighty vel (spear) given by Goddess Parvati, Murugan confronted Surapadman, who transformed into a massive tree. Murugan struck the tree with his spear, splitting it into two halves and vanquished Surapadman who sought forgiveness from the Lord. Murugan pardoned him and transformed his two halves into a rooster and a peacock. The rooster became his banner and the peacock became his vahana.

12/02/25, 9:08 pm - Nalini N R: I am really amazed at the perception and the perspective. Though crow has never attracted me personally, it is so nice to read Bharatiyar poem where he is reminded of Krishna in a crows feather! Like sparrows crows have also slowly started disappearing. We are left with pigeons whose sound I can't stand hope there will be no poem written on the current generation of pigeons ☹️
12/02/25, 9:19 pm - Nalini N R: Thank you Sir for the details and the sculpture is so very beautiful. I think it is very difficult to chisel the peacock which has feathers and can clearly see the eye though I can't make out the extension.

13/02/25, 12:39 pm - Dr Raguram: AUTUMN SONG
Like a joy on the heart of a sorrow,
The sunset hangs on a cloud;
A golden storm of glittering sheaves,
Of fair and frail and fluttering leaves,
The wild wind blows in a cloud.
Hark to a voice that is calling
To my heart in the voice of the wind:
My heart is weary and sad and alone,
For its dreams like the fluttering leaves have gone,
And why should I stay behind?

14/02/25, 8:00 am - Dr Raguram: Love is in the air once again and let us cast our glance beyond red roses and chocolates and delve deeper to unearth its roots in the vast and vibrant tapestry of Indian culture. 
Rig Veda in Nasadiya Sukta comments on the origin of the universe, wherein desire is recognized as the primal source:
तम॑ आसी॒त्तम॑सा गू॒ळ्हमग्रे॑ऽप्रके॒तं स॑लि॒लं सर्व॑मा इ॒दं।
तु॒च्छ्येना॒भ्वपि॑हितं॒ यदासी॒त्तप॑स॒स्तन्म॑हि॒ना जा॑य॒तैकं॑
काम॒स्तदग्रे॒ सम॑वर्त॒ताधि॒ मन॑सो॒ रेत॑: प्रथ॒मं यदासी॑त्।
स॒तो बन्धु॒मस॑ति॒ निर॑विन्दन् हृ॒दि प्र॒तीष्या॑ क॒वयो॑ मनी॒षा॥४॥
There are numerous, often varying interpretations of these verses. In essence it states that “in the beginning, darkness was hidden by darkness with no distinguishing sign; all of this was water. The life force that was covered with emptiness arose through the power of heat. Desire (kama) arose in it in the beginning; that was the first seed of the mind. Wise sages seeking in their hearts, with wisdom, found it to be the bond that connects existence with non-existence.”
It is a phenomenally perceptive way to describe the origin of desire and its influence.
The formless desire had to find a form and the Hindu pantheon found its own cupid, Kamadeva.
Kamadeva and Rati weave a tale beyond mere desire. It's a passionate love story, defying death and destiny. Kamadeva is an alluring deity, wielding a bow and arrow adorned with flowers and bees, capable of kindling the flames of love in any heart. In one notable tale, the gods, seeking to preserve the cosmic equilibrium, wished for Shiva, the Destroyer, to rediscover love. Engrossed in profound meditation, Shiva remained oblivious to such desires. To provoke him, Kamadeva took action, striking the meditative god with an arrow of love. The repercussions of this act were unexpected. Shiva, disturbed from his deep meditation, became enraged. He activated the formidable power of his third eye, reducing Kama to ashes. Overwhelmed with grief, Rati fell at the feet of the Lord and beseeched him to spare her husband. Touched by her desperate pleas, Shiva revoked his actions and brought Kamadeva back to life, with a rider that he would be formless from that day onwards. Though remaining unseen, he wields his arrow bursting with blossoming flowers and bees to kindle and awaken the spirit of love in humans. 
In verse 6 of Saundarya Lahari, Adi Shankaracharya writes:
धनुः पौष्पं मौर्वी मधुकरमयी पञ्च विशिखाः
वसन्तः सामन्तो मलयमरु-दायोधन-रथः ।
तथाप्येकः सर्वं हिमगिरिसुते कामपि कृपां
अपाङ्गात्ते लब्ध्वा जगदिद-मनङ्गो विजयते
“Oh ,daughter of the mountain of ice,
With a bow made of flowers,
Bow string made of honey bees,
Five arrows made of only tender flowers,
With spring as his minister,
And riding on the chariot of breeze from Malaya mountains
The god of love who does not have a body,
Gets the sideways glance of your holy eyes,
And is able to win all the world alone.”
This sculpture from Khajuraho has beautifully captured the rapturous expression of love in Kamadeva and Rati.

15/02/25, 8:57 am - Dr Raguram: We relate and discover the world around us in different ways. Artists express it through subjective, intuitive approaches whereas the scientist relies on objective, measurable methods. Both art and science venture into the frontiers of the unknown, exploring and trying to grasp its essence. Galileo, whose birthday is today, blended these two perspectives remarkably in his works. 
As a youngster, he was trained in music and became adept at the lute. He also had a keen eye and was quite skilful in drawing. Galileo emphasized on a methodical approach to the study of the universe, and inspired the modern scientific method that remains a bedrock of scientific inquiry even now. He was the first man to raise a telescope to the skies and see beyond the limited boundaries of the Catholic Church. To his great dismay, he was ordered to stop believing what he could see with his own eyes. He was summoned to see the Pope, tried by the Papal court, and was condemned to spend the rest of his life in his house under armed guard. After the Inquisition, overwhelmed with the fear of being burned at the stake, Galileo recanted his theories and writings, asked for forgiveness and his life was spared. He spent much of his final years, blind and ailing. In those dark days, the aging scientist again found solace in his lute. 
Galileo utilized a scientist’s keen eye to discern the secrets of the universe, and an artist’s to make them intelligible to the world. The epitaph on his tombstone succinctly summarizes his work, “But The Earth Does Move.”
Galileo lived in a period where the church was dominant and people blindly followed their ideologies while the church was afraid that his radical discovery would change the world order. Bertolt Brecht wrote a brilliant play, ’Life of Galileo’ in which through the story of Galileo he wanted the audience to question the role of totalitarianism and its impact on scientific endeavours. It is a truism that the scientific community is a part of the structure of the government and its orientation and survival depends on the power and ideological framework of the government. Galileo’s life is a stark reminder that it is an unremitting struggle to protect science from religious chauvinism and the power of those who govern.

18/02/25, 8:34 am - Dr Raguram: Saints and seers have drawn inspiration and spiritual knowledge from objects of nature. Often our spiritual journey has been described by mystics as the flight of a bird.
Birds played a crucial role in Sri Ramakrishna’s life. When he was a six-year-old, he was walking along the fields and suddenly the sky was overcast with thick black clouds. A flock of white birds flew across the clouds. When Sri Ramakrishna saw this, (his name was Gadadhar then), he was totally absorbed in the sight, was motionless and he became unconscious. Later on he said, “That was my first ecstasy.” It was his first spiritual, mystic experience which caste its impact in many of his sayings & teachings.
In one of the prayer meetings, he narrated a story, “A bird sat on the mast of a ship. When the ship sailed through the mouth of the Ganges into the 'black waters' of the ocean, the bird failed to notice the fact. When it finally became aware of the ocean, it left the mast and flew north in search of land. But it found no limit to the water and so returned. After resting a while it flew south. There too it found no limit to the water. Panting for breath the bird returned to the mast. Again, after resting a while, it flew east and then west. Finding no limit to the water in any direction, at last it settled down on the mast of the ship. What a man seeks is very near him. Still he wanders about from place to place. As long as a man feels that God is 'there', he is ignorant. But he attains knowledge when he feels that God is 'here'.”
There was an interesting incident when Sri Ramakrishna mentioned that a devotee is like a ‘chataka’ bird. This bird will drink only rainwater, as it falls from the clouds. So it is always watching the sky. As the bird watches the sky, so the devotees always look to God to appease the thirst of learning. Naren, (Swami Vivekananda) was listening and he exclaimed: "Sir, though it is the common belief that the ‘chataka’ bird drinks only rainwater, it is not a fact that it does not take other kinds of water. I have seen these birds drink water from rivers and ponds." Sri Ramakrishna said: "Is that so? Do they drink like other birds? Then I am mistaken. If you have seen it, then there is no doubt about it." But Sri Ramakrishna, was a little disturbed, "If I am mistaken in this, then I may also be mistaken in other ways too." After a few days Naren called Sri Ramakrishna and said: "Sir, see a ‘chataka’ bird is drinking Ganga water." Sri Ramakrishna rushed out of the room and said: "Where? Where?" When they came near the spot, what they saw was just a small bat. Sri Ramakrishna laughed and said: "You rogue; it is a bat. You have given me so much trouble for nothing. Now I shall be wiser and not believe everything you say!”
Sri Ramakrishna also used the analogy of the mythical ‘Homa Bird’ to explain the intense renunciation and spiritual aspiration of the seeker. The bird lives quite high up in the sky and lays egg at that height. Because of the height the egg keeps falling for many days.  While falling, it hatches and the chick continues to fall.  This goes on for many days. One day the chick opens its eyes and realizes about the impending death if it hits the ground.  Then it gives a shrill cry and shoots up towards its mother. It keeps going in the upward direction and does not look behind. Sri Ramakrishna used to call Naren who later became Swami Vivekananda as a ‘Homa Bird.’ 
When I looked at the logo of Ramakrisha Math (which was designed by Swami Vivekananda), I was struck with its striking similarity with the logo of my alma mater, NIMHANS, except for the serpent encircling it. It is believed that when milk diluted with water is given to the swan, it sips only the milk, leaving the water behind. Water represents ignorance and the milk symbolizes knowledge. The image of the swan signifies the discerning mind that is in pursuit of the Real.
According to the ancient tradition, ascetics who strive to gain liberation are classified into four classes. They are kuṭīcakas, bahūdakas, haṃsas and paramahaṃsas. Paramahamsa refers to the highest level of spiritual development of an enlightened, exalted soul.

24/02/25, 10:13 am - Dr Raguram: Ibn Battuta was a medieval Muslim explorer, scholar and an intrepid traveller. He began his travels in the 14th century when he was just 20 years old and over the course of the next 29 years he travelled about 75,000 miles, visiting 44 countries. Near the end of Ibn Battuta's life, the Sultan of Morocco insisted that he dictate the story of his travels and today we can read translations of that account, which is generally referred to as Ibn Battuta’s ‘Rihla’, or journey. It is available online and makes a fascinating read. 
Ibn Battuta’s travels in India were mostly in the north and towards the end of his stay, he came down to the Malabar coast. When I was reading about the accounts of his sojourn in the Malabar coast, I was astonished by his keen sense of observation about people and places. He gives an accurate description of the most important produce of the region, pepper.
“The pepper-bushes look like vines. The natives plant them opposite the coco-nut trees around which the pepper-bushes climb like vines; but they have no tendrils ('aslūj) as in the case of vines. The leaves of the bush look like leaves of asafoetida and also like the leaves of the blackberry bush. The pepper-bush bears small bunches of fruit, the grains of which resemble those of abūqinnina as long as they are green. When autumn comes the pepper is plucked and exposed on reed-mats to the sun just as is done with grapes when they are turned into raisins. It is continually turned round until it is completely dry and becomes black; then it is sold to the merchants. The common people in our country think that it is roasted by the fire, whence the wrinkles on the pepper-grains come. But it is not so, since the wrinkles are caused by the sun. I saw the pepper grains in the city of Calicut (Qālıqül) emptied out into bushels as is done with the millet in our country.”
Reading ‘Rihla’ I felt as if I was following the footsteps of this peripatetic traveller who remarked, “traveling, it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller”

25/02/25, 8:17 am - Dr Raguram: Pain and distress is inevitable as we course along in life. It is our innate vulnerability. Sometimes it results in withdrawal from the world outside of us. On those occasions an overwhelming sense of isolation can envelop us. Artists give expression to it in myriad ways. Visually, Vincent van Gogh conveyed those moments through his arresting palette. Many poets and writers narrated it powerfully in their works. And talented musicians strum our chords within, with such experiences.
Ahalya and myself are avid aficionados of Simon and Garfunkel. Today, by chance we listened to the epochal song, ‘I Am a Rock’. The heartfelt lyrics of Paul Simon are embedded in sublime music in his mellifluous voice. It is sheer poetry. Even though there is no particular rhyming scheme, there are lines that significantly rhyme. Each verse peels back another layer of deeper meaning. 
‘I Am a Rock’ is more than just a song; it’s a window into the soul of a remarkably talented artist who expresses the indefinable feeling of the human need to retreat inward in a most poignant manner. 
I AM A ROCK By Paul Simon
A winter's day
In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock I am an island
I've built walls
A fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock I am an island
Don't talk of love
Well I've heard the word before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock I am an island
I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock I am an island
And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries

26/02/25, 9:43 am - Dr Raguram: Mahashivaratri commemorates the wedding of Shiva and Parvati. It has profound spiritual, cultural, and philosophical significance as it venerates the holy union of two greatest forces of the universe; masculine and feminine energies.
Cave 21 in Ellora, also known as Rameshwara Cave, is located midway between Cave 16 and 29. and was excavated in the late 6th century AD. It is dedicated to Lord Siva and a Nandi is placed just in front of the cave over a raised platform. Stunning sculptures adorn the walls of the huge mantapa. On the northern wall, there is a beautiful panel which depicts the marriage of Shiva and Parvati. Shiva is seen holding the hands of Parvati who is tilting her head toward him bashfully. Vishnu and Lakshmi are seen to the left and Brahma is officiating the marriage on the bottom right. On top on either side are celestial beings and divinities watching the holy union. 
Kalidasa begins his famous epic poem Raghuvamsa with this verse 
वागर्थाविव संपृक्तौ वागर्थप्रतिपत्तये ।
जगतः पितरौ वन्दे पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ ।।
“I bow to the mother and father of the world, Parvati and Parmesvara (Shiva), who are inseparably conjoined, just like a word and its meaning are inseparably bonded.”

27/02/25, 8:42 am - Dr Raguram: We all long for the home. It is less a physical space than a place filled with enduring memories. Those memories never fade completely and have the power to catapult us back through time. Its centripetal force has an irresistible allure. 
Sometimes, home can be elusive. Particularly when one is living far away and keeps longing to return to a land which is in throes of conflict. Often there is a deep yearning for that familiar, comforting place, especially when the situation doesn’t fulfil the need to return. There is a beautiful Welsh word ‘Hiraeth’ that has no direct English translation. It refers to a homesickness tinged with grief and sadness.  A poet who gave expression to that feeling most powerfully in modern times was Mahmoud Darwish, a Palestinian author. He spent most of his time as a refugee and spent his final days in the US.  Mahmoud Darwish died on 9 August 2008 and his mortal remains were buried next to the Palace of Culture at Ramallah.
Mahmoud Darwish’s “To My Mother” is one of the most poignant poems I have ever read and the following lines resonate deeply within. 
“I am old
Give me back the stars of childhood
That I may chart the homeward quest
Back with the migrant birds,
Back to your awaiting nest.”
I was reminded of these lines when I saw a sunbird making frequent sorties to feed and nurture it’s chick. The chick would be quiet most of the time and the moment she heard the fluttering wings of the mother, would start making a low pitched chirping noises. In a few days, as its wings grow stronger, it will fly away from the nest but memories of the nest would remain deeply etched in its being.

03/03/25, 9:18 am - Dr Raguram: Travels in India are always a revelation. Ahalya and myself just returned after savouring some of the most beautiful sculptures in two monuments: Chinthala Venkataramana Swamy and Bugga Ramalingeswara Swamy temples in Tadapatri. Tadapatri is small little town in the hinterlands of Andhra Pradesh and off the tourist radar. Both places which are ASI monuments, are adorned with exquisite sculptures. I will be posting them in detail later.
One of my passions in the past decade has been to see and record mural paintings in South India. After the Cholas, Vijayanagara and Nayak kings had a distinct penchant to embellish the places of worship with stunning paintings, usually done with vegetable dyes. I have documented several of these treasures during our travels.
Since both these temples were built during the Vijayanagara period I was keen to see whether there were some murals on the ceilings of the structures. It was much akin to a search for an elusive bird. To my great dismay in both places, the plaster has fallen off from the ceiling or has been painted over. After a fervent and losing struggle, I spotted this one. It portrays a bejewelled, saree clad lady. The ornamentation and attention to detail was quite striking. Despite the ravages of time and callous neglect, there was a sempiternal charm that percolated through the peeling layers of paint.
Beauty fades but often the soul shines on…

04/03/25, 9:34 am - Dr Raguram: I was not aware of the teachings of Baba Shaikh Farid till I read the book about him edited by Prof Gurbachan Singh Talib. Baba Farid was a great Sufi mystic, teacher and poet. He was born in the month of Ramadan in the year 1173 CE at a place near Multan called Kotheval.  He was named after the Sufi poet Fariduddin Attar. Farid in Arabic language means 'Unique'. He came to be known also as Shakarganj or Ganj-i-Shakar (Treasury of Sugar). There is an interesting story behind this nickname. Farid’s mother Qarsum Bibi, used to place a small packet of sugar under the prayer mat as a reward for the child to say his prayers regularly. Once she forgot to put it under the mat. To her great surprise a packet of sugar appeared in the usual place. Following this miracle, he came to be known as ‘Shakarganj.’ Another explanation attributes the title 'Shakarganj' to the blessing which Farid received from his spiritual teacher, Khwaja Qutubuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki (the famous Qutb Minar in Delhi was built in his name) who praised the sweetness of Farid’s disposition and remarked; "You shall be sweet like sugar."
There is a beautiful story attributed to Baba Farid;
“Once a king came to see him. He had brought a present for Farid. It was a beautiful pair of scissors, golden, studded with diamonds. It was very valuable, rare and unique. He touched Farid’s feet and gave him the scissors. Farid looked at it and gave it back to the king, and said, “Sir, many many thanks for the present that you have brought. It is a beautiful thing, but utterly useless for me. It will be better if you can give me a needle. Scissors I don’t need: a needle will do.” The king said, “I don’t understand. If you need a needle, you will need scissors too.” Farid said, “I don’t need scissors because scissors cut things apart. I need a needle because it can put things together. My whole teaching is based on love, bringing people together. I need a needle so that I can stitch them together. The scissors are useless; they cut, they disconnect. Next time when you come, just an ordinary needle will be enough”.
These lines are so pertinent now in a world brimming with growing distrust. Too often we underestimate the power of compassion that can bind us together. Let us untether the love deeply buried in our hearts and heal ourselves and the ‘others’.
In Rumi’s eloquent words;
“I will soothe and heal you,
I will bring you roses.
I too have been covered with thorns.”

06/03/25, 9:57 am - Dr Raguram: Michelangelo famously observed that "Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it." For him, the process of sculpting involved bringing out the ideal form lurking inside. Each one of us has an ideal self and our aspiration in life is to actualize it. Relationships, especially close, intimate ones like in marriage have an important role in facilitating the emergence of the ideal self in each other. The process would involve identifying qualities in our partners that already exist within them, but remain latent. Like sculpting a statue from marble, couples can gently chip away at each other’s rough edges to reveal their inner beauty. This is often referred to as the ‘Michelangelo Phenomenon.’ Just as Michelangelo saw the process of sculpting as releasing the ideal forms hidden in the marble, close partners sculpt one another to bring out the best in each other. Like the sculptor, the partner doesn't create something out of nothing, he or she brings out qualities that inherently exist.
We all hold visions of our “ideal selves” that long to be realized. Our partners can be the chisels and mallets that gently unveil our inner potential through affirmation and support over the course of a relationship. In this way partners can affirm and empower each other’s growth. 
However, wielding the chisel is a delicate process. When one partner imposes his/her vision of the ‘ideal self’ onto the other, it can lead to deep resentment in the partner, leading onto tremendous strain and distress. There is also the possibility that one might subjugate the real, aspiring self to meet the partner’s expectations. 
We are all capable of breaking free from the limitations that hold us back to discover the beauty that is confined inside of us. A caring, sensitive partner can play a catalysing role in facilitating that process.
In the words of Michelangelo, “I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free”

08/03/25, 8:11 am - Dr Raguram: The Vedic period witnessed the advent of highly intelligent, erudite women seekers. The Rig Veda mentions around 27 to 30 Rishikas or women seers and they were known as Brahmavadinis, women of high scholarship. Brahmavadinis dedicated their entire lives to learning, teaching and spreading knowledge through their tapasya. The 125th hymn from Book 7 of the Rig Veda, the Devi Suktam, is credited to Rishika Vak Ambhrini, the daughter of the great seer Ambhrina. It is also known as Vak Suktam. She is among the most ancient women poets of the world.
The Vak Suktam abounds with divine energy. She has not composed it as one would compose poetry. It is a spontaneous outpouring of her realizations and divine experience. She identifies herself as the Supreme Goddess herself, embodying the divine feminine consciousness. It celebrates the divine feminine, celebrating the cosmic power, nurturing presence, and boundless strength of the goddess. The verses describe Devi as the supreme source of creation and sustenance, embodying qualities of both a fierce protector and a gentle nurturer. Each line acknowledges her presence in all forms of life, as well as her ability to guide us through life’s challenges with grace and resilience. When we chant the Vak Suktam, we align ourselves with this powerful feminine force, energizing our inner strength and resilience.

09/03/25, 10:26 am - Dr Raguram: Ukraine's history has been marked by conflict and hardship, with periods of occupation, famine, and war, leaving a "blood-soaked" legacy. It was ruled by various empires, including the Mongols, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire, till it declared independence in 1991.
The tragic history of Ukraine found its expression in many outstanding works of writers and poets who were detained and executed by the Soviet authorities. Prominent among them was Taras Shevchenko, a Ukrainian poet, writer, artist, folklorist, and ethnographer. He is considered as a founder of the modern Ukrainian literature and a major symbol of Ukrainian nationhood. 
In spite of the current disposition of policy makers towards Ukraine, various leaders in USA had honoured Shevchenko and the aspirations of the people of Ukraine. Harry Truman was an honorary head of the Shevchenko Monument Committee. Dwight Eisenhower cleared the way for the monument to be installed in Washington and John F. Kennedy facilitated implementation. In his letter, he called Shevchenko’s poetry a “noble part” of American historical heritage. Lyndon B. Johnson said:  "He was more than a Ukrainian, he was a statesman and citizen of the world. He was more than a poet, he was a valiant crusader for the rights and freedom of men. He used verse to carry on a determined fight for freedom.”
The Taras Shevchenko Memorial is a bronze statue which stands in the Dupont Circle neighbourhood of Washington, D.C. George HW Bush invoked this verse of Shevchenko written more than a century ago which inscribed on the monument:
“Our soul shall never perish,
Freedom knows no dying,
And the greedy cannot harvest
Fields where seas are lying;
Cannot bind the living spirit,
Nor the living word,
Cannot smirch the sacred glory
Of the almighty Lord”

10/03/25, 10:32 am - Dr Raguram: I was listening to a podcast which was a three hour long conversation between podcaster Joe Rogan and Elon Musk. In the course of his diatribe, Musk made an astounding statement, “We’ve got civilizational suicidal empathy going on…the fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy.” This kind of techno-fascist worldview would leave us isolated from one another, indifferent to reality, and unconcerned with the suffering of others. It left me wondering whether he has walked out of the pages of Ayn Rand’s works like ‘Atlas Shrugged" and "The Fountainhead.’
Ayn Rand’s philosophy of “Objectivism” focused on reason over emotion, highlighting Individual self-interest and happiness over collective happiness. Objectivism emphasizes individualism, capitalism, and rational self-interest. Rand observed, “My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.” Musk has often expressed his admiration for Ayn Rand's writings and has indicated that her ideas resonate with his own views.
Musk undoubtedly is a talented and an inspired innovator. Yet his ruthless selfishness and intellectual precocity is unmistakable, especially in this statement about empathy. Equating empathy with weakness is a perilous perspective. Empathy builds bridges, and the strong ties that bind together society. Lack of empathy can result in dehumanization and fuel brutality. Psychologist Gustave Gilbert, who interviewed Nazi leaders during the Nuremberg trials, observed “It’s the one characteristic that connects all the defendants, a genuine incapacity to feel with their fellow man. Evil, I think, is the absence of empathy.”

It was a pleasure to see a large group of them on our morning safari. We spent several minutes just observing them and then they crossed over to the other side, led by the matriarch. As we were watching (from a safe distance!), a tusker advanced quite close towards us. The guard said ‘hat, hat’ and it stopped in its tracks, thankfully. Later on he mentioned that if the elephant’s ears are waving and the trunk is loose, it most probably indicates a fake charge.

18/03/25, 9:59 am - Dr Raguram: John Updike is a favourite author of mine. I have assiduously devoured most of his large literary oeuvre. He is an astute chronicler of the American middle class, especially in his Rabbit series novels. 
A few years ago, I accidently picked up his little known book, ‘Self-Consciousness: A Memoir’. One of the essays in the books is titled ‘At War with My Skin’, which is a poignant description of his lifelong personal struggle with psoriasis. Writing about a chronic debilitating condition like psoriasis is not an easy task. As Updike reflects, “It pains me to write these pages. They are humiliating —‘scab¬picking,’ to use a term sometimes levelled at modern autobiographical writers.” 
Updike started developing psoriasis when he was just six years old. Both his mother and grandmother were similarly afflicted. Psoriasis is a condition that is not contagious, painful, or debilitating; yet it has the volatility of a disease with an unpredictable fluctuating course.  Often the first response is one of concealment: "Psoriasis keeps you thinking. Strategies of concealment ramify, and self-examination is endless. You are forced to the mirror again and again. Psoriasis compels narcissism, if we can suppose a Narcissus who did not like what he saw." The sufferer feels alienated and pines for relief and cure: "One hates one's abnormal, erupting skin but is led into a brooding, solicitous attention toward it. One hates the nature that has imposed this affliction, but only this same nature can be appealed to for erasure, for cure." 
Updike attributes the reason he became a writer to his psoriasis: “Because of my skin, I counted myself out of any of those jobs – salesman, teacher, financier, movie star – that demand being presentable. What did that leave? Becoming a craftsman of some sort, closeted and unseen – perhaps a cartoonist or a writer, a worker in ink who can hide himself and send out a surrogate presence, a signature that multiplies even while it conceals”. He relates his productivity to psoriasis: “What was my creativity, my relentless need to produce, but a parody of my skin’s overproduction? Was not my shamelessness on the page a distraction from my real shame?”
An illness like psoriasis is a rift in one’s life trajectory. They are like rocks in the quickly moving stream of life which we have to negotiate and cross. Personal narratives as articulated in ‘At War with My Skin’ provide metaphorically, buoys through which individuals in the throes of an ailment chart and steer through the turbulent eddies of the illness-waters that we will all face at some time in our lives.

20/03/25, 9:13 am - Dr Raguram: Ovid was a Roman poet who lived and worked during the reign of the emperor Augustus. He is widely considered as one of the top three Roman poets, along with Virgil and Horace. He wrote many works, but his most famous one was the ‘Metamorphoses’, which is considered his magnum opus. Ovid's ‘Metamorphoses’ is a book that is challenging to classify as it doesn't have the same sense of cohesive narrative like many other epic poems. It is a collection of approximately 250 sections, written in verse, some of which span many pages while others are much shorter in length. The poems move in chronological order from the creation of the world to the coronation of Julius Caesar. Each section deals with some myths and in each myth, there is a significant change in form, like the metamorphosis of one character into another body or figure. These often provide resolution or closure, as in stories where women, pursued by attackers, transform themselves into birds, trees, or other creatures in order to avoid being abused and exploited. 
It is a daunting task to read the original and I settled for an excellent abridged translation by Ted Hughes. The key undercurrent in the work, as I gather after reading it, is that nothing remains static in life and change is inevitable. Every ending heralds something anew to unfold.

21/03/25, 9:24 am - Dr Raguram: I love forests. We just came back from Manas National Park. It is a magical landscape studded with magnificent trees stretching their arms towards the sky. Each tree was so distinctively different from one another, much like us. Though different, each of them made their presence felt in their own ways. The forest was humming with life around us. When the wind caressed the leaves, the mellifluous sounds and cadences emerged as nature’s symphony. The early morning sun was making its way through the leaves. The Japanese have a wonderful word, ‘Komorebi’, to describe the dappled light filtering through leaves.
For me personally, forests are spiritual landscapes, offering a space for an intimate connection with the sacred. When I cast my eyes in the vast canopy of treetops, I lose myself amidst its mystical web of wonder. 
As J Krishnamurti observed, “Love not the shapely branch, nor place its image alone in your heart. It dies away. Love the whole tree; then you will love the shapely branch, the tender and withered leaf, the shy bud and the full-blown flower, the falling petal and the dancing night, the splendid shadow of full love. Ah, love life in its fullness. It knows no decay.”

23/03/25, 9:36 am - Dr Raguram: These are times when people are busy on the hedonistic treadmill, testing their prowess in the social media with sheer abandon. This scenario is of particular concern amongst the young. Their everyday life is often woven around the social media, sharing pictures and messages. They spend hours in the digital world, while parents are lulled into thinking that they are busy with their studies. Adolescence is a particularly key period when young people are grappling with forming a sense of self, situating their place in the world and the social media can have a great impact on it.
On this background, the  Netflix series ‘Adolescence’ is quite timely. It lays bare the myriad forms of cyberbullying, the malign influence of social media and the unfathomable pressures faced by adolescents. It lays bare how an outwardly normal but inwardly self-loathing and susceptible youngster can be radicalised without anyone noticing it, through his forays into the cyber world. His parents recall him coming home from school, heading straight upstairs, slamming his bedroom door and spending hours at his computer. They believed they were doing the right thing by providing him a safe personal space. It’s a scenario which will ring a bell with many parents in India. The questions it poses are urgent and vital. Every episode unfolds with great sensitivity and the main actors are so true to life. Particularly remarkable was the way in which the school psychologist handles a troubled adolescent, calmly and with quiet purpose. There is an overwhelming and urgent need to address this issue at the individual, family and school levels to ensure that the adolescents do not fall through the cracks and disappear down the digital rabbit hole. 
Technically, the way it has been picturised is very innovative. Each episode of ‘Adolescence’ is shot in a seamless style, without a single edit. It is an ground-breaking cinematographic style and a stunning technical accomplishment.
The climactic scene of the father tearfully tucking his son’s childhood teddy bear into his bed and apologising to it saying, “Sorry, son, I should’ve done better” is devastating and will remain etched in memory for long.
I strongly feel that it should be widely seen by parents, teachers, educationists and mental health professionals alike.

24/03/25, 9:22 am - Dr Raguram: I first read David Suzuki’s ‘The Sacred Balance: Rediscovering Our Place in Nature’, a decade ago. It is a passionate exploration of our connection with nature that surrounds us and how best to conserve it. He emphasizes that we have to shift our perspective from ‘anthropocentrism to ecocentrism.’ Suzuki links care for the environment to our fundamental human physical, social and spiritual needs. He writes eloquently, “Every breath is a sacrament, an affirmation of our connection with all other living things, a renewal of our link with our ancestors and a contribution to generations yet to come. Our breath is a part of life's breath, the ocean of air that envelopes the earth.” He is deeply concerned about global warming and observes, “We're in a giant car heading towards a brick wall and everyone is arguing over where they're going to sit.”
We all focus on economic growth and worry about GDP. GDP calculations must incorporate environmental costs and benefits and quantify the contribution of the ecosystem in monetary terms, so that we recognize its importance in development. It is time to put ‘eco’ back into economics and in all aspects of our daily lives.

A pair of Malayan Giant Squirrels were leaping across the trees and chasing one another like adept athletes. It was a wonderful sight to them both. After this, one was resting comfortably in a tree branch while the other was going up and down in the tree trunk. I had closer look at both of them. They were more than a foot and half in size with deep brown colour on the back and creamy underparts. There was a distinct black marking below the eyes. I had never seen such a large squirrel before! It is the largest of India’s giant squirrels. It is considered an ‘indicator species of a healthy forest ecosystem.  The Malayan Giant Squirrel is considered as ‘near threatened’ according to IUCN. A study by the Zoological Survey of India has projected that numbers of the Malayan Giant Squirrel could decline by 90% in India by 2050. According to researchers of the study, if conservation efforts are not in place, we may lose the Malayan Giant Squirrel altogether.

27/03/25, 9:04 am - Dr Raguram: On the way back to Guwahati from the Manas National Park, I was keen to have a glimpse of the Greater Adjutant. I had seen them in the huge dump yard on the outskirts of the city several years ago and wrote about them. This time around when we tried to locate the dump yard, we came to know that it has expanded to two sites, indicating the amount of waste generated by the city. With some help from the locals and losing the way often, finally we located the earlier dump yard. Massive piles of rubbish like a small mountain with an overwhelming stench welcome us. The Greater Adjutants were right on top with their unmistakable, tall, imposing presence. Their numbers seemed to be much less compared to our earlier visit. 
The Greater Adjutant is called ‘Garuda’ locally. It is one of the most endangered bird species and its major habitat is in the Brahmaputra valley of Assam. The birds are found mostly in three districts of Assam; Guwahati, Morigaon, and Nagaon. With rapid decline in the wetlands, which are essential for them to forage for food, they are now forced to rely on garbage dumps. Purnima Barman who is affectionately known as “Hargila Baideu”, ‘Stork Sister’, has done remarkable, pioneering work in the conservation of these birds which are deemed to be on the “EDGE” (Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered) species, close to extinction.
As we were leaving,  the birds were soaring high on the sky, with hopes ensconced in their majestic eight feet wing span.

28/03/25, 11:25 am - Dr Raguram: One of the most vital tenet of mysticism is its call for self-annihilation as an important prerequisite for the ultimate union with the Divine. It emerged in life and writings of two women who lived far apart and could not possibly have known of each other; St Teresa of Avila and Akka Mahadevi. 
St. Teresa of Avila, was a 16th-century Spanish mystic and a Catholic saint, who was born on this date in 1515. She wrote a book, the "Interior Castle" to describe the individual soul's journey towards its unification with God. Reading through it, I was struck by her use of the metaphor that the castle has seven mansions, each representing a different stage of spiritual development. I thought that these seven mansions are akin to transiting through seven planes of consciousness to realize the Divine. St Teresa of Avila provides practical advice and insights as to how prayer, meditation further the path towards the ultimate merger with God. The final stage is one intense ecstasy of realisation of the deepest amalgamation with the Divine. St. Teresa of Avila emphasized that it is only through complete renunciation and total surrender to God, one can experience the Divine. 
Like her, Akka Mahadevi relinquished all worldly possessions, including her clothing, in a radical act of spiritual devotion. This decision was not merely an act of defiance against societal expectations but emerged from profound spiritual convictions. She believed that true devotion to God necessitated annihilation of self and complete detachment from materialistic trappings. Her Vachanas are replete with her deep desire to merge with her beloved Chennamallikarjuna. She writes;
“How can milk swallow ghee and remain separate?
Who can separate fire from the sun’s radiance?
Chennamallikarjuna,
Great One without bounds
seeing how you are hidden within me not separated
I opened my eyes.”
Both St Teresa of Avila and Akka Mahadevi forged an inseparable bond with the God spirit through unflinching devotion and a life of ultimate renunciation, summarized eloquently in a Vachana by Akka Mahadevi;
“Like treasure hidden in the ground, 
like flavour in the fruit, 
like gold in the rock 
and oil in the seed, 
the Absolute is hidden in the heart.”

I was reading Nikolai Gogol’s powerful story ‘Memoirs of a Madman’, which was published in 1835. The story follows the descent into insanity of Poprishchin, a low-level civil servant who becomes convinced that he is the rightful heir to the Spanish throne; “Spain has a king. He has been found. I am that king. Only this very day did I learn of it. I confess, it came to me suddenly in a flash of lightning. I don’t understand how I could have thought and imagined that I was a titular councillor”. He starts hearing dogs speak to one another. More interestingly, he hears them discussing letters they have written to each other; “I confess, lately I had begun sometimes to hear and see things no one had ever seen or heard before. Ah, you pup! I was very surprised to hear her speak in human language. But later, when I’d thought it over properly, I at once ceased to be surprised”. The hallucinations and delusions became more frequent, he was taken to the hospital; “I think I’m safe in hazarding a guess that I’ve fallen into the hands of the Inquisition, and the person I thought was a minister of state was really the Grand Inquisitor”. His stay in the hospital was not too pleasant as he was subjected to various kinds of physical treatments; “they began dripping cold water on my head. I’ve never experienced such hell before… Judging by all probabilities, I guess I may have fallen into the hands of the Inquisition”.
The story ends on a poignant note; “O mother, mother, save your unhappy son! Let a tear fall on his aching head! See how they torture him! Press the poor orphan to your bosom! He has no rest in this world; they hunt him from place to place. Mother, mother, have pity on your sick child!”
The story is a moving portrayal of Poprishchin’s delusions of grandeur, hallucinations, and finally his complete break with reality. As Ben Okri commented, “The fact of storytelling hints at a fundamental human unease, hints at human imperfection. Where there is perfection there is no story to tell.”

03/04/25, 9:08 am - Dr Raguram: Victoria Chang is a talented young poet and is the Bourne Chair in Poetry at Georgia Tech and also the Director of Poetry@Tech. Georgia Tech has an endowed chair in poetry, one of the few in the country. Its mission statement states the reason of it eloquently, “nothing antithetical in a major university known the world over for its engineering/architecture/computational science/management, and other related subjects of study, also making available to its students writing, literature, and the arts in general. The making of art (let’s use poetry as an example!) is a task that requires a kind of engineering, a kind of architecture, and very real and complex technical skills. Good poems, historically, are made; they don’t flow down the arm of the dreamy poet to the page. Good poems are the result of planning, rigor, attention, intuition, trial and error, discipline, and the luck that sometimes comes when all of the above are applied. A flawless architectural design, an elegant chemical equation, a good poem is supposed to seem simple, spontaneous, fluid. To achieve his or her goals, that precision, that truth, the engineer, the chemist, the architect, the poet usually must work diligently, must sweat blood.” 
In other words, good poems emerge from inspired engineering!
Victoria Chang wrote a wonderful book, “The Trees Witness Everything” and I am particularly drawn to these lines from it;
“Every leaf that falls
never stops falling. I once
thought that leaves were leaves.
Now I think they are feeling,
in search of a place..”

06/04/25, 10:07 am - Dr Raguram: There was once a yaksha, named Suketu, who had no children. Craving for children, he performed a yaga. He was blessed by Brahma, who said Suketu would have a girl child, who would have the strength of 1,000 elephants, and that girl was Tataka. When Tataka attained marriageable age, she was given in marriage to Sunda. Sunda was killed by Agastya'a curse. Enraged, Tataka went with her son Mareecha to kill Agastya. The sage cursed Mareecha and said he would become a demon. He said Tataka would become ugly and would repulse people with her looks. From then on, Tataka became a ferocious demon and began to destroy the beautiful land that had once been prosperous. Driven by rage and the curse, Tataka terrorized the Dandaka forest, turning a once-prosperous land into a wasteland. Tataka's demise at the hands of Rama, guided by Vishvamitra, marks a pivotal moment, showcasing Rama's righteousness and establishing him as a protector of dharma.  
In Valmiki Ramayana, the slaying of Taṭaka is narrated in Bala Kanda, Sarga 26,
तामापतन्तीं वेगेन विक्रान्तामशनीमिव || १-२६-२५
शरेणोरसि विव्याध सा पपात ममार च |
This sculpture in Chinthala Venkatramana Temple in Tadipatri in Anantapur District depicts this incident in Ramayana. Rama is aiming an arrow at Tataka. It pierces her and she falls down. The sculptor with extraordinary creativity has captured this moment with a single fluid depiction.

12/04/25, 10:04 am - Dr Raguram: Parasrampura is a nondescript village in Jhunjhunu district, near Nawalgarh in the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan. We were keen to see the Chhatri (cenotaph) erected in 1750 in memory of Thakur Shardul Singh which is said to house some of the oldest frescoes of the region. When we reached the place we found it to be overgrown with weeds and poorly maintained. But once we cast our glance inside the dome, we were transported into a magical realm, the likes of which we had never set our eyes on before. Miniature paintings adorned the entire ceiling. Each and every inch was decorated with intricate paintings done in ochre tones. They depicted events in the life of Thakur Shardul Singh, interspersed with episodes of Hindu mythology, especially the penultimate battle of the Ramayana.
During the battle of Lanka, Lakshman was grievously wounded by Indrajit, son of Ravana. Seeing Lakshman was close to death, Jambavan commanded Hanuman to fetch immediately ‘Sanjivani booti’, a powerful medicinal herb that has the power to revive the dead found only on the Dronagiri mountain. Hanuman leapt up and soared through the skies across a great distance to Dronagiri to fetch the life-saving herb. But having reached Dronagiri mountain Hanuman could not identify the plant Sanjivani. As he could not afford to waste time searching for the herb, he quickly tore up part of the whole mountain The villagers of the tiny hamlet of Dronagiri in Uttarakhand, identify a nearby mountain as the mythical Dronagiri mountain mentioned in the Ramayana. But they have a totally different take on this tale. They are angry and refuse to forgive Hanuman for mutilating the right flank of their precious mountain. As per the local beliefs, when Hanuman flew into the region in search of the Sanjivani plant to revive Lakshman, the villagers of Dronagiri did not reveal the identity of the magical mountain to him as it was sacred to them. But time was running out and Lakshman was near death, so Hanuman disguised himself as an old sage and begged an elderly woman in the village to help him identify the magical mountain where the herb grew. The woman took pity on the sage and pointed out the mountain which was thickly populated by various shrubs and trees. Hanuman then proceeded to uproot half of the mountain and carried it away along with the magic herb. The villagers were furious and punished the old woman. Reportedly, since Hanuman destroyed a part of their sacred mountain, the villagers of Dronagiri village do not keep an idol of Hanuman in their homes even today.
This section of the fresco depicts Hanuman carrying the Sanjeevi Parvatha with portrayal of the Thakur Shardul Singh’s court on the left side of the panel.

15/04/25, 9:47 am - Dr Raguram: Each year, on 15 April, World Art Day is celebrated to draw attention to the links between artistic creations and society and encourage greater awareness of the diversity of artistic expressions. This date was specifically chosen to honour the birthday of Leonardo da Vinci.
The artistic traditions in India has a vast repertoire, comprising of painting, sculpture, architecture, and performing arts. Many of these traditions are deeply rooted in the country's cultural and religious heritage, with styles evolving over time. These art forms have been passed down through generations, with artists often learning their skills from their families. 
Indian mural art, in particular, boasts a rich history dating back to the 2nd century BC, with examples found in various locations across the country, including caves and temples. These murals depict religious and secular themes, reflecting the diverse cultural landscape of India. Different regions have unique mural traditions. Over the years, I have been documenting the mural paintings during the Vijayanagar and later Nayak period 16th through 18th centuries.
On this day, let me draw attention to this enchanting mural dating back to the first half of 18th century in the Ramalinga Vilas Palace at Ramanathapuram. It depicts the celebration of Vasantostava. The king Muthu Vijaya Raghunatha is astride a navanari kunjara (elephant formed by nine women) and his queen is riding panchanari turaga (horse formed by five women). The king is depicted as Manmatha and the queen as Rati and they are shooting flowery arrows at each other.
Nava Nari Kunjara, meaning ‘elephant made of nine women,’ is a recurring motif in Indian art, particularly in Mughal miniature paintings and Pattachitra paintings of Odisha and West Bengal. It depicts an elephant formed from the intertwined figures of nine women, often symbolizing the nine Rasas (emotions) in Hindu aesthetics. In Panchanari Turaga a horse is depicted comprising five female figures. It is believed to symbolize the power and beauty of female energy. 
Do have a careful look at the painting and marvel the skill of the unknown artist.

The Yoshino cherry (also known as the Japanese flowering cherry) is the darling of the flowering tree world and the star of such renowned events as the National and International Cherry Blossom Festivals. This striking tree is known for its vibrant display of white-pink blossoms and faint almond fragrance in the springtime. Japanese legend states that each spring a fairy maiden hovers low in the warm sky, awakening the sleeping cherry trees with her delicate breath. The legend surrounding the Yoshino cherry blossoms, particularly on Mount Yoshino, centres around Enno Gyoja, the founder of Shugendo, who carved the mountain deity Zao-Gongen from a cherry tree, making these trees sacred. The preservation and care of these trees are entrusted to dedicated cherry blossom guardians known as Sakuramor. 
The ephemeral nature of the blossoms, which last only a week or so, is often portrayed in Japanese art and literature as a symbol of the transience of beauty and life itself. They inspired me too!

18/04/25, 8:53 am - Dr Raguram: Good Friday is the most pivotal day when Jesus willingly suffered and died by crucifixion as an ultimate sacrifice. Crucifixion is a particularly unusual scene to be depicted on Mughal Manuscripts. In this painting dating back to 1590, Jesus is depicted nailed to the cross as one of his assailants climbs down a ladder. Around them further figures look on and behind them is a landscape dotted with trees and hills. There is a lovely gold-illuminated coloured borders around the painting, decorated with silver floral motifs.
Mahakavi Bharathiyar had immense respect for all religions and wrote a poem about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ;
“ஈசன் வந்து சிலுவையில் மாண்டான்
எழுந்துயிர்த்தனன் நாள் ஒரு மூன்றில்
நேசமா மரியா மக்தலேநா
நேரிலே இந்தச் செய்தியைக் கண்டாள்
தேசத்தீர் இதன் உட்பொருள் கேளீர்;
தேவர் வந்து நமக்குட்புகுந்தே
நாசமின்றி நமை நித்தங் காப்பார்
நம் அகந்தையை நாம் கொன்றுவிட்டால்.”
“My Lord deceased on the Cross
And ascended in three days
Beloved Mary Magdalene

The gods will enter us
And guard us from all ills
If we transcend our pride.”

19/04/25, 9:08 am - Dr Raguram: Yet another World Heritage Day (18th April), has passed on. It raises an uncomfortable question, have we really taken care of the plethora of ancient gems which crave for attention all over the country? In our travels we found that many of these historically invaluable monuments are in a severe stage of neglect.
For instance, when we were travelling in Tirunelveli district we were keen to visit the Sathya Vageeswarar Temple in Kalakad. In addition to beautiful sculptures it is said to have more than 200 mural paintings, which are 400 years old. With great effort we got the necessary permission and when we visited it, there was no one around. We went around the temple savouring all the wonderful sculptures and after an hour, an official arrived. These murals are on the inner walls of each of the nine tiers of the temple’s gopuram. We climbed the inside of the gopuram in darkness. The steps were quite high and narrow. The official led the way with a torch with an intimidating stick. I wondered why he was carrying it. Our doubts were answered when we arrived at the first tier of the gopuram. Countless bats were hovering around us and there were resident monkeys who were making threating sounds. Fortunately, the official kept them at bay with the stick. The floor was littered with bat droppings and we gingerly made our way around them. There was no light inside and we started scanning the walls with the light from our mobile phones. Every inch of the wall was covered with murals depicting scenes from the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and episodes from the life of Saivite saints of Tamil Nadu. We were deeply saddened to see their derelict condition. Even though the paint had worn off due to years of neglect their innate beauty shone through layers of the murals. We climbed all the nine tiers and seeing the murals on each tier, was like watching a moving gallery of fading images which glowed in the light from our mobiles. 
We slowly climbed down with a deep sense of disquiet. These priceless repositories of the past crave for attention and careful restoration. It is a sad story of monumental neglect. Without concentrated efforts at conservation these murals will just fade away. If we create awareness about these treasures and integrate their histories into our educational systems, perhaps there might be a greater urgency to preserve them. It is also important not to leave this responsibility to governmental agencies with are already functioning on a shoe string budget. Involvement of the local community is extremely crucial to conserve these sublime remains of the past. 
Unfortunately, it is the same story in many monuments of interest. When our son Rahul was young we had taken him to the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura, near Mysore. There were two beautifully carved elephants flanking the steps and we had taken a photo of him with them. When we visited years later both of them were missing. I called the ASI person and asked him and he staunchly defended that no such sculpture ever existed there! 
It is a sad fact that we have failed in our moral responsibility to take care and preserve many of the beautiful monuments across the country.
Hope we are able to break this circle of neglect…at some time!

22/04/25, 12:42 pm - Dr Raguram: The phrase "Earth laughs in flowers" comes from the poem "Hamatreya" by Ralph Waldo Emerson, wherein flowers are presented as a symbol of the earth's resilience and joy, often interpreted as a mockery of human attempts to dominate nature. Emerson believed that humans are ultimately transient and will return to the earth. The origin of the poem's title is unclear, because there is no Hindu word or name "Hamatreya." Perhaps it is an adaptation of "Maitreya," one of the characters in the Hindu text “Vishnu Purana”, who is engaged in a dialogue with the Vishnu. Vishnu tells Maitreya about the Hindu kings who mistakenly believed themselves as the possessors of the Earth. But the kings have disappeared, while the Earth endures. Vishnu recites the chant of the Earth and pities the egotistical kings and their blindness to their mortality. Human efforts to build empires and leave their mark on the earth will ultimately be futile. The earth, on the other hand, with its natural cycles of rejuvenation will always be alive, communicating joy and happiness through its flowers.

23/04/25, 9:26 am - Dr Raguram: I grew up with books. On every birthday there was no cake to cut, but books to savour. I devoured them so fast that I needed glasses at a young age. That did not deter my quest to unravel secrets tucked into inked pages. The smell of books was so irresistible that I surrounded myself with scores of them. Libraries were my sanctuary where I retreated to find succour and company. I couldn’t afford to buy them till I started earning. The salary as a young psychiatry resident opened the doors of Premier and Select Book Shops. Mr Shanbhag and Mr Murthy guided my forays and fuelled my quest further. I started buying books and slowly the collection increased. Aware of my interest, the gifts my friends gave were mostly books. They were all piled in all available spaces in the quarters we lived in. When we moved to our new abode, our first task was to house them all in a bedroom which metamorphosed into a library. Sometimes I have to cautiously step onto a ladder to locate a book on ceiling high shelves. When I start my day ensconced amidst them, it's like all my friends sitting on shelves are waving their pages at me. They then begin talking and I start a conversation with them afloat on a magic carpet gliding through imagined landscapes. Each book is like a stepping stone offering a new perspective and a fresh lens to view the world and oneself. As I venture further, I start feeling at home in that inward journey.

26/04/25, 8:34 am - Dr Raguram: Situated besides the Nambi river and against the backdrop of the Western Ghats (Mahendragiri) in Tirunelveli district is the Azhagiya Nambi Rayar temple at Thirukkurungudi. Nindra Nambi or Azhagiya Nambi is also called as “Sundara Paripoornam”, meaning “Perfect and complete beauty”. It is one of the most beautiful temple I had ever visited. Every corner of the temple premises is decorated with exquisite sculptures. Some of the most delicate carving are in the Chitra Gopuram. 
This particular panel illustrates the story of Gajendra Moksham. It is a small rectangular panel. Dominant figure is that of eight armed Vishnu, seated on Garuda, who is depicted with human face and body and wings. Garuda has infinite strength, so he comfortably bears Vishnu. Vishnu’s kirita makuta is a fascinating contrast to the jatamakutas which adorn Siva. Gajendra is beseeching Vishnu to deliver him from the clutches of the crocodile which has as strangle hold on its legs. On the top are munis, hands in worship who are witnessing this event.
Gajendra Moksha, meaning "the liberation of the elephant," is a story from the Bhagavata Purana about a king named Indradyumna, who was cursed in a past life to be born as an elephant named Gajendra. In his present life, Gajendra is attacked by a crocodile while at a lake, and he prays to Lord Vishnu for help. Vishnu, upon hearing Gajendra's prayer, intervenes and frees Gajendra from the crocodile's grasp, granting him liberation.
The Gajendra Moksha story, highlights the importance of surrendering to Lord Vishnu for liberation from suffering and the cycle of rebirth. Gajendra, the elephant, is rescued by Vishnu after being captured by a crocodile, symbolizing the release from ignorance and material attachments. The story emphasizes the power of devotion and the importance of seeking refuge in the divine during times of distress. The water symbolises our material world or samsara. The crocodile is maya which forever tries to pull the soul into samsara and its bondage.
The Gajendra Moksha Stotra, a prayer within the Srimad Bhagavatam, captures this dialogue between the devoted soul and the divine. The hymn highlights the transformative power of unwavering devotion, which offers liberation. 
मादृक्प्रपन्नपशुपाशविमोक्षणाय मुक्ताय भूरिकरुणाय नमोऽलयाय
O Lord of great compassion, liberated from the shackles of surrendered animals like me, I offer my obeisance to You.

28/04/25, 7:39 am - Dr Raguram: It must have been a beautiful morning when scores of people made their way to Baisaran which is often referred to as "Mini-Switzerland". Reportedly it is one of the most scenic places near Pahalgam. When people settled down in the lovely large green meadow with the grand backdrop of pine trees and mountains they would have hardly anticipated the turn of events. Suddenly, bullets rained down on unsuspecting people, mostly men, who were shot at very close range. Horror and terror must have engulfed their companions who ran to safety. In that moment their lives changed for ever. The emotional trauma they experienced will leave a lasting impact among the survivors.
Even on reading about the incident and the experiences of the survivors, one is overwhelmed with a deep sense of anguish. Often it is difficult to express that pain in words. Sometimes, creative artists unmask that feeling in paintings. I recall the iconic painting of Edward Munch, ‘The Scream’. It features a figure with a terrified expression, surrounded by a swirling, vibrant landscape that reflects the emotional intensity of the moment. Munch used a distorted form and intense colours to unveil that moment of intense dread. In his words, “I felt tired and ill. I stopped and looked out over the fjord — the sun was setting, and the clouds turning blood red. I sensed a scream passing through nature; it seemed to me that I heard the scream. I painted this picture, painted the clouds as actual blood. The color shrieked.” 
‘The Scream’ stands as a timeless reminder of the existential dread that can make inroads into our lives and overwhelm us at the most unanticipated moments in our lives. The painting’s shriek, echoes deeply within our hearts. It unites us all in collective empathy and determination to respond to the anguish and pain with renewed resilience. 
Sometimes the most painful tears are not the ones that fall from our eyes. They're the ones that tumble from our hearts and find their way to those in throes of unbearable anguish.

28/04/25, 12:57 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir it is no doubt a horrifying experience, most unexpected unlike a natural disaster which has left behind the near and dear ones in inconsolable distress.

29/04/25, 8:51 am - Dr Raguram: As I was ambling through the vast Angkor Wat temple complex, savouring myriad sculptures that adorn it’s walls, I was particularly drawn to thousands of intricate stone carving that depict the dance of the Apsaras. The term "Apsara" refers to celestial nymphs or divine dancers in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, and are believed to be supernatural beings who entertain gods and kings with their graceful movements. The Apsara dance is a traditional Cambodian (Khmer) classical dance deeply rooted in Hindu and Buddhist mythology. It dates back to at least the 7th century and flourished during the Angkorian era (9th–15th centuries), particularly under King Jayavarman VII (12th century), whose court reportedly included over 3,000 Apsara dancers. The dance was performed at royal courts for ceremonies, festivals, and religious rituals, symbolizing a connection between the divine and human realms. The dance nearly vanished during the Khmer Rouge regime (1975–1979), when many artists were killed. It was revived in the mid-20th century and one can watch its performance at Siem Reap. Unfortunately, we know very little about the meanings and gestures of dance in ancient Cambodia. While a Sanskrit dance treatise, the Natyasastra, sheds light on ancient dance in India, no such text has survived in Cambodia.  While the legacy of dance was transmitted orally and bodily, the Apsara dance performed today is often a modern reinvention. This particular dance form was created in the late 1950s by Queen Kossamak.  The frontal focus, the twisted movement of bodies, and the flexible hand gestures seen in contemporary Apsara dance are derived from and inspired by the different poses depicted on Angkorian stone reliefs. 
The Apsara dancers of Angkor Wat are more than just exquisite carvings on temple walls; they are symbols of Cambodia’s enduring spirituality, artistry, and cultural identity. Rooted in Hindu mythology yet shaped by Cambodian creativity, these Apsaras embody ideals of grace, beauty, and spirituality in a dance form that resonate across generations.
As Martha Graham commented, “Dance is the hidden language of the soul.”

30/04/25, 9:11 am - Dr Raguram: On the occasion of Basava Jayanthi let us recall the life and works of Lord Basaveshwara, also known as Basavanna or Basava. Born in 1134 AD in Basavana Bagewadi, Vijayapur District, Karnataka, he stands as a remarkable 12th-century social reformer. His works and revolutionary ideas transcended borders, advocating for equality through challenging caste and gender-based discrimination. His Vachanas blend spiritual devotion to Lord Shiva, advocating equality and rejecting caste and ritualism. Basavanna envisioned a society where all are equal under Siva’s divine kinship, like in this Vachana.
“ಇವನಾರವ, ಇವನಾರವ ಇವನಾರವನೆಂದೆನಿಸದಿರಯ್ಯಾ,

“Do not ask, “Who is this man, who is he?”
Say instead, “He is one of us, he is ours.”
O Lord of the meeting rivers,
Proclaim him as a son of your house.”
A timeless message which is so pertinent in these times, which emphases the importance of  universal brotherhood, urging us to transcend social divisions”

01/05/25, 8:36 am - Dr Raguram: Today is International Workers' Day, which honours the contributions of the workforces globally. Worker bees, though small, are nature’s ultimate labourers. A worker bee is a female honey bee that performs various tasks to maintain the hive. Unable to lay eggs, she takes on roles like foraging for nectar and pollen, cleaning the hive, feeding larvae, producing wax, and guarding the entrance. Their work shift with age: younger bees handle hive duties, while older one’s forage. Each hive has thousands of workers, forming the backbone of the colony's survival. Worker bees are vital pollinators, supporting 75% of global food crops through pollination, ensuring food security and biodiversity. This critical role is much akin to the indispensable contributions made by human workers in various walks of life. Like human workers facing exploitation or poor conditions, worker bees too endure threats like pesticides, habitat loss, and climate change, which shorten their lives. Worker bees embody the essence of labour. 
Like the worker bees labouring selflessly, let us work for common good in the hive of our lives.

02/05/25, 8:51 am - Dr Raguram: Kalabhairava is a fearsome, yet revered, form of Lord Shiva. He is known as the destroyer of time, a protector, and a guardian against negative forces. He is also considered a deity who removes fear and protects devotees from enemies like greed, anger, and lust. 
This beautifully chiselled Kalabhairava sculpture is at Halebidu's Hoysaleshwara Temple. He is depicted with multiple arms holding various weapons. There is a dog licking the blood from a decapitated head on the bottom right. The sculpture also features Kali, the Goddess of time and destruction, dancing on Bhairava's side, symbolizing the cosmic dance of creation, preservation, and dissolution. The KalaBhairava sculpture in Halebidu is a powerful representation of Bhairava's role as a destroyer, a guardian, and a symbol of the transformative power of time and nature. The sculpture's intricate details and symbolic elements make it a captivating work of art and a testament to the rich artistic traditions of the Hoysala period.
The Kalabhairava Ashtakam, was composed by the revered Adi Shankaracharya, in 8th Century CE. It is a powerful prayer to Lord Kalabhairava, and consists of eight stanzas (Ashtakam) that praise the attributes of Kalabhairava and seek his grace and protection. The Ashtakam is believed to offer protection from negativity, enhance courage, and promote spiritual growth. One of the ashtakam states;
शूलटपाशदण्डपाणिमादिकारणं 
श्यामकायमादिदेवमक्षरं निरामयम् । 
भीमविक्रमं प्रभु विचित्रताण्डवप्रियं 
काशिकापुराधिनायकालभैरवं भजे ॥ 
I worship Lord Kalabhairava. Who holds (in His hands) the trident, the axe, the noose and the rod and who, is the Primal Cause of the Universe, who the Primeval God has a blue body, and who, is imperishable and pure, and the Lord of terrific prowess, fond of the wonderful dance.

03/05/25, 7:15 am - Dr Raguram: Vietnam war culminated on April 30, in 1975. It remains an outstanding example of squandered military valour. But more than that it was a vast preventable tragedy. The death toll is estimated to be around 1 to 3.8 million.  Not all of these were military personnel; nearly half of the deaths of the Vietnam War were the deaths of civilians caught in the fighting. 
There have been many literary accounts of the futility of war. For me personally Joseph Heller’s ‘Catch 22’ was a very incisive fictionalized narration of the realities and absurdities of war. Set on an island off the coast of Italy during World War II, it tells the story of Yossarian, an American bomber who is coming to grips with the dehumanizing impact of war on people. It is a unique fusion of satire, surrealism, and black humour to illustrate the terrible psychological effects of war. Heller reveals the brutalizing effects of combat, the deterioration of morals, and the loss of personal agency suffered by those caught up in war. It is a satirical and anti-war masterpiece. The phrase ‘Catch-22’ is used in the novel to describe a bureaucratic paradox that Yossarian and his fellow soldiers are trapped in. It often creates a situation where a soldier is caught in a catch-22 position: he can’t be grounded if he’s sane, but asking to be grounded is evidence of his sanity. Basically it draws attention to a plight when one is damned if they do and damned if they don’t, and the futility of trying to escape a situation that is inherently contradictory. 
As Heller observes "Outside the hospital the war was still going on. Men went mad and were rewarded with medals. All over the world, boys on every side of the bomb line were laying down their lives for what they had been told was their country, and no one seemed to mind, least of all the boys who were laying down their young lives…..It doesn't make a damned bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead."

08/05/25, 8:52 am - Dr Raguram: Rabindranath Tagore was an ardent lover of nature. For him the wide-open skies and tranquillity of the countryside symbolised freedom. Not surprisingly, he envisioned education as a holistic process with close linkages with nature, fostering creativity and personal growth. Tagore saw the traditional formal education system as overtly focused on rote memorization and exams, which stifled creativity, alienating students from their cultural roots and the natural world around them. 
Tagore articulated his perspective about education through a short story "The Parrot's Training," It is a powerful satire that exposes the flaws of an inflexible educational system. The story depicts a king who orders his nephew to "educate" a parrot by forcing it to learn from books. The parrot initially considered "illiterate," is confined to a golden cage and subjected to rote memorization. With text-book in one hand and baton in the other, the pundits forced the bird to learn the lessons. It ultimately loses its natural singing voice and becomes a sad mimic. Unable to cope up with this forced tutelage, the parrot finally dies. The king orders the bird to be brought to him and when he pokes its lifeless body, he finds that its innards are stuffed with books: “only its inner stuffing of book-leaves rustled.” 
Tagore uses the parrot as a metaphor of a child in the formal education system. The parrot represents a child who is forced to conform to a rigid system that stifles creativity, natural learning, and individual needs, leading to a loss of natural abilities. In his view, “education is not the filling of a pail but the lighting of a fire.” 
I wonder whether we have heeded to the prescient message of Tagore. The learning spaces of today have metamorphosed into commodified, shiny concrete cages that are adoringly fitted with modern gadgets with a draconian emphasis on ‘performing well’ that sucks away the vibrant spirit of learning.

They have weaving, gardening, sports, dance, music, arts and crafts, attend to goshala, taught Bhagavad Gita from very low classes, visits to the forests and slowly bring them to the mainstream and students have scored very high in CBSE.

10/05/25, 9:15 am - Dr Raguram: During our sojourn in the Rann of Kutch we were keen to have a glimpse of the Grey Hypocolius. We drove around on an early morning and spotted it, perched on the higher branches of ‘Salvadora Persica’, also known as the Miswak tree. Its twigs and roots are used to clean teeth due to their antibacterial properties. Prophet Muhammad reportedly recommended its use to maintain oral hygiene. 
Hypocolius are generally shy birds and it so wonderful to see it. It was oblivious to our presence and was savouring the berries in a leisurely fashion. Hypocolius migrates from West Asia to Western India during winter, with the Greater Rann of Kachchh being a major wintering ground. They breed in areas like Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan, and winter in the Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan, and Western India.
War significantly impacts bird migration. The sounds of blazing guns and flashing lights from the bombs often frighten the birds, forcing them to search out new migratory routes and some of them might perish during the journey. In spite of it, they make the journey with hope tucked in their feathers. 
These migratory birds connect people, ecosystems and nations. They are symbols of peace in a world in throes of turmoil.

11/05/25, 11:10 am - Dr Raguram: Hoysala art is known for its intricate and detailed carvings, and Narasimha sculptures are no exception. Narasimha, the man-lion incarnation of Vishnu, whose advent is celebrated today, is prominently featured in many Hoysala temples throughout Karnataka. There are two representations of Narasimha; Ugra (fierce) and Yoga (meditative). The former is much more common.
The Kedareshwara Temple is just a kilometre away from the main Hoysaleswara Temple in Halebidu, but it is not as well known. Many people who visit Hoysaleswara Temple miss out on seeing this beautiful temple. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, it is a brilliant example of medieval Indian temple design. This particular panel depicts Ugra Narasimha as a fearsome form with a lion head, a human torso, and a powerful physique, with multiple arms. Two of his hands are holding Hiranyakashipu, the demon king, firmly on his lap. With two other hands he is opening the abdomen of Hiranyakashipu and one can see the intestines coming out, which Ugra Narasimha is wearing as a garland around him. 
Ugra means "ferocious" and this image of Ugra Narasimha devouring Hiranyakashipu symbolizes the destruction of negative forces and the triumph of good over evil. By vanquishing the demon, Ugra Narasimha re-establishes order and harmony in the cosmos, restoring the balance that was disrupted by the evil forces. Ugra Narasimha transcends mere visual representation. He urges us to stand up for what’s right and embrace our own inner strength in the face of injustice.
11/05/25, 4:33 pm - Nalini N R: It looks so elegant,and can be mistaken to the branch of a tree. War can hamper the routine of all living things...

12/05/25, 9:28 am - Dr Raguram: Buddha Jayanti honours three major events in the Buddha's life: his birth in Lumbini, his attainment of enlightenment under the Bodhi tree in Bodhgaya, and his Mahaparinirvana in Kusinaga. When Buddha is meditating under the Bodhi tree, Mara tries to tempt and distract him. Buddha's encounter with Mara is a pivotal moment in Buddhist history, encapsulating the core of his spiritual journey, facing and transcending obstacles on the path to enlightenment.
In cave number 26 at Ajanta, there is an elaborate relief panel which depicts how Mara confronts and disturbs Buddha who is in deep meditation. In the centre of the panel, Buddha is in the varada (bestowing gifts) mudra and sits under the Bodhi tree. In the upper left half of the panel, the evil demon Mara is seen sitting astride a large elephant.  His fearsome forces are shown all around, trying to defeat the Buddha before he achieves enlightenment. Mara’s three daughters Rati (lust), Trishna (thirst), and Arati (delight) dance at the Buddha’s feet, with hopes of breaking his meditation with lustful advances. In the bottom right hand corner, a dejected and defeated Mara is portrayed with his hand to his head beside his daughters. 
The tale of the Buddha's victory over Mara is a timeless narrative that captures the core of the Buddhist journey to enlightenment. In Buddhist teachings, Mara's temptation symbolizes the obstacles and distractions that hinder spiritual progress. It teaches that the quest for truth and liberation demands unwavering determination, the capacity to conquer desire, fear, and doubt, and the readiness to turn adversity into spiritual growth. 
Buddhacarita, is the poetic narrative of the life of the Buddha by the Sanskrit poet Ashvaghosha, and is one of the finest examples of Buddhist literature. Chapter 13 details the defeat of Mara and ends with this sloka;
“tathāpi pāpīyasi nirjite gate diśaḥ praseduḥ prababhau niśākaraḥ |
divo nipeturbhuvi puṣpavṛṣṭayo rarāja yoṣeva vikalmaṣā niśā”
“When the wicked one thus fled vanquished, the different regions of the sky grew clear, the moon shone forth, showers of flowers fell down from the sky upon the earth, and the night gleamed out like a spotless maiden.”

17/05/25, 9:35 am - Dr Raguram: Myself and Ahalya went over to the tribal school at Wayanad, which we support, to congratulate the students who had performed well and their teachers and other staff. Since it was holiday for the school, we couldn’t meet all the students. After the COVID epidemic when the school reopened the teachers noticed that there was a significant decline in the academic skills of the students. They had to work really hard to help them regain the skills and it has been a remarkable and dedicated work on their part to achieve 100% results. 
Ms S secured the highest marks in the school. She hails from the Paniya community which is the largest tribal group in Wayanad. They are predominantly agricultural workers, having historically been employed as bonded labourers on plantations. It was an extremely poignant moment for me when I was informed that she was orphaned at a young age. Her father was killed in a clash with a relative and the mother remarried and abandoned Ms S. In spite of the hardships that she has faced in her life, Ms S strove hard to overcome her trauma and excelled in her studies. The sparkle in her eyes will linger on within me for long.
Personally I feel that even the smallest act of kindness can make a difference. In a world that often feels divided, choosing to help others reminds us that we are all part of a shared human existence and that kindness is the glue that binds us together. There is an old proverb:
परस्य नौः उद्धृत्य स्वयम् अपि तटम् गच्छति

18/05/25, 8:17 am - Dr Raguram: Endangered Species Day is observed annually on the third Friday of May, and is dedicated to raising awareness about threatened species and the importance of conserving these species. At least 900 species are already extinct till date, while at least 28,5000 others are listed as endangered or critically endangered by the IUCN, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which is the global wildlife conservation authority. It classifies species into one of nine Red List Categories: Extinct, Extinct in the Wild, Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable, Near Threatened, Least Concern, Data Deficient and Not Evaluated. 
The red-headed vulture is listed as being Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. This classification reflects the species' precarious population status and high risk of extinction. This is one of the 9 species of vulture which are found in India. It is also called the Asian King vulture or Pondicherry Vulture. The red-headed vulture is one of the few species of large vultures that does not live in big groups and is usually found alone or as a breeding pair. With its wingspan of over two metres the red-headed vulture is truly impressive especially when it is flying. Like most vultures their diet consists of carrion and they have been observed feeding on the carcasses of cattle. They play a crucial role in the ecosystem by cleaning up animal remains. This species has experienced a dramatic decline in both population size and distribution. In India it has been estimated that the population decreased by over 90% in just 10 years. This decline has been largely attributed to the use of the drug Diclofenac by veterinarians. 
Mr Bharatidasan through his NGO ‘Arulagam’ has played a stellar role in drawing attention to the importance of conserving this species through consistent, dedicated, efforts in the field. He along with his team has been educating the villagers about the consequences of usage of diclofenac through conducting village meetings, programs in the schools and involving senior members of the community in the conservation efforts. I had known him for over a decade and he is truly an inspiration. It was a privilege to accompany him to his field area and observe the tangible impact of his efforts. I will never forget the experience of seeing at least a hundred of various vultures, including the Red headed vulture, which are considered to be critically endangered.
In the Ramayana, there are references to two vultures, Jatayu and Sampati. While the tale of the former is rather well known, the role of Sampati, remains largely overlooked. Sampati sacrifices his wings to shield Jatayu from the sun's heat, leading to his own loss of ability to fly. Later, with his exceptional eyesight, he spots Sita in Lanka and guides Hanuman and the Vanara army towards her location. Though Jatayu and Sampati are key figures in the epic which is read widely, vultures have had a negative reputation in the minds of people as they feed on carcases. Often referred to demeaningly as "nature's garbage collectors", it fails to acknowledge the crucial importance of vultures in sustaining our environment.
Vultures like the Red headed ones are the unsung heroes of our ecosystem and saving them should be our responsibility and a top priority.

20/05/25, 9:23 am - Dr Raguram: Every time I watch the bees, I am amazed how seamlessly and effectively they seem to carry out their job. They flit from blossom to blossom and when they had gathered enough, they take off and fly, heading to their hive. Bees, whose brains only have about 1 million neurons compared to the 86 billion or so in the human brain, navigate the world, avoid collisions and escape danger while accomplishing a task. I am sure that they have an accurate conceptual mental map of the space they have to negotiate. I wonder whether they have been the inspiration for robotic drones which are being used in many different ways…from warfare to agriculture.
More importantly, bees draw attention to the importance of collaborative existence. Each bee has a specific role; worker, drone, or queen and they function as a cohesive unit for the colony's survival. Grounded in millions of years of evolutionary experience, bees highlight the power of working as a unified whole while respecting individual differences and valuing varied contributions. 
Perhaps, it is an important reminder on the World Bee Day for our leaders to adopt a "queen bee" mind set, which is not authoritarian, but inspiring and unifying purposeful co-existence for common good.

21/05/25, 9:10 am - Dr Raguram: Last week we were in the Nagarhole forest on an early morning safari. It was quite misty and in the dapple light streaming through towering trees, the forest came alive with the hum of life. The fleeting glimpse of the dholes, graceful chitals frolicking amidst the tall grass and the whispers of birds waking up was a mesmerizing experience. The forest pulls us in, it is an irresistible pull that reconnects us with something primeval within ourselves. 
The raw, untamed beauty of the forests has kindled the creative spirit in many artists. For me the dreamlike paintings of Henri Rousseau have a special appeal. His unconventional canvases brim with vivid colours depicting lush vegetation, exotic animals, like this one titled ‘Exotic Landscape.’ The leaves, grass, the trees of the jungle are all painted in opulent shades of green. Monkeys are picking up oranges hanging from the trees and on the ground.
Rousseau's paintings like this one, are not realistic depictions but rather creative, ingenious renderings of the jungles, which succeeds in creating a sense of wonder. He was not trained in any formal art school and his paintings are reflective of his fascination with nature and his imaginative world. They are almost like a childlike view of the forest landscapes.  
“It is a world of vibrant hues
Where dreams take flight
Drawing us in.”

22/05/25, 8:53 am - Dr Raguram: While birding in Munnar, I suddenly heard a distinctive, repetitive clicking sound and I knew that the Malabar Giant Squirrel was somewhere in the midst of the canopy. As I was trying to locate the where the sound was coming from, I saw a flurry of activity. And there it was, scurrying up the trunk of the tree. It suddenly hurtled itself across to another tree, soaring for several meters before grabbing hold a branch in the adjacent tree. It was like watching an agile, trained athlete making a final dash to touch the finishing line. I was keen to have a closer look at it, but it was tirelessly scurrying across the trees. I gave up the search and to my great surprise, after a few minutes, it landed up a few feet away from where I was, peering at me closely. Our eyes locked for a minute before it slithered away. 
At that moment I was reminded of Rumi’s timeless words, “What you seek is seeking you.” 
The poem reads;
“Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing
and right doing, there is a field.
I’ll meet you there.
When the soul lies down in that grass
the world is too full to talk about.
What you seek, is seeking you.”

23/05/25, 9:26 am - Dr Raguram: I am besotted with the hornbills, particularly the Great Indian Hornbill. My first sighting of this majestic bird was in Karian Shola in Anamalai Tiger Reserve, near Coimbatore. The stately bird with a commanding presence flew in to feed the chick in the nesting hole, high up in the tree. Over the years many more sightings ensued, almost all of them alone or in pairs. It was different when we went birding recently in the Royal Manas National Park. There were scores of them flying around and perching on trees. I have never seen so many of them together in my life. The forest came alive in their colourful presence.
The Great Indian Hornbill plays a crucial role in sustaining biodiversity by acting as a key agent in seed dispersal, which is crucial for forest regeneration and the overall health of the ecosystem. They are referred to as "farmers of the forest" or "engineers of the forests" because they play a vital role in dispersing seeds of various tropical trees. They consume a wide variety of fruits, including figs, and then disperse the seeds through their droppings in different locations, away from the parent plant. This helps in preventing competition among seedlings and aids in forest regeneration. By dispersing seeds, they help establish new tree populations and ensure the diversity of plant life in the jungle. Their presence and activity contribute to a healthy ecosystem by supporting the growth and diversity of plant life, which in turn supports other wildlife. 
In India we are blessed with a wide variety of biomes ranging from driest deserts to the moist rain forests, which harbour an astounding variety of flora and fauna.  It is a sad fact that we have lost 90% of them which are biodiversity hotspots. Ravaging the biosphere in the guise of ‘development’ will leave lasting impact on the health of the planet and our wellbeing too.
The life around us is an intricate, diverse, beautiful web. On this day let us commit ourselves not to fray it further.

24/05/25, 9:30 am - Dr Raguram: Among this year’s Pulitzer Prize winner is Marie Howe, for her poetry collection, ‘New and Selected Poems’. When I was reading it, I was drawn into a diverse world of experiences.  Howe seamlessly transforms everyday observations into profound meditations on the human condition. One of the perennial questions that daunts each one of us is what is the meaning and purpose of life. Personally I have found answers to this when I immerse myself in the natural world; whether it is observing birds or just being in the midst of a silent forest, embracing stillness. Jiddu Krishnamurti drew attention to the importance of observing nature without judgment or attachment, viewing it as a path to understanding oneself and one's relationship with the world. Marie Howe articulates this perspective beautifully in this poem, ‘The Maples.’ She suggests that through embracing stillness, and being present in the ordinary moments mindfully is the key to a meaningful life. 
THE MAPLES
“I asked the stand of maples behind the house,
How should I live my life?
They said, shhh shhh shhh…
How should I live, I asked, and the leaves seemed to ripple and gleam.
A bird called from a branch in its own tongue,
And from a branch, across the yard, another bird answered.
A squirrel scrambled up a trunk
then along the length of a branch.
Stand still, I thought,
See how long you can bear that.
Try to stand still, if only for a few moments,
drinking light      breathing.”

27/05/25, 9:40 am - Dr Raguram: On her birthday today, 27th May, let us recall Rachel Carson whose work profoundly shaped the environmental movement. In her most influential work ‘Silent Spring’, Carson’s drew attention to the devastating effects of pesticides, particularly DDT, on ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. The book documented how indiscriminate pesticide use harmed birds, fish, and other organisms, disrupting food chains and causing widespread ecological damage. Its evocative title referred to a future where birdsong might vanish due to pesticide-induced deaths. The book’s impact was monumental. It sparked national debate and led to the eventual U.S. ban on DDT in 1972. It also drew attention to the fact that we are part of an interconnected ecosystem and how indifferent actions can have a rippling effect endangering it. 
Insecticide use is a double-edged sword. While they offer benefits like increased crop yields and disease control, they also pose risks to human health and the environment. Unfortunately, pesticide use in India has significantly increased, especially in recent decades, driven by factors like climate change, the need for increased agricultural output, and the adoption of high-yielding crop varieties. There is growing concern about their impact on human health and the environment, including potential contamination of soil and water. 
On this background, the stellar contributions of Rachel Carson are all the more relevant now. If we don’t pay heed to her observations, we will end up in a world where “the sedge has withered from the lake/ And no birds sing.” These lines are from John Keats' poem "La Belle Dame Sans Merci". It describes the withering of the sedge (a type of grass) at the lake, signifying a sense of desolation and decay in a barren and bleak landscape devoid of the rejuvenating songs of the birds.
In every brilliantly veined leaf, in every grain of food that we partake, there is a beautiful story of the earth which we have to attune ourselves to.

28/05/25, 9:06 am - Dr Raguram: We reached Elkhorn Slough early in the morning to have a good glimpse of its rich aquatic life. We got into the boat and made our way through its tidal flats, creeks and marshes, all teeming with amazing variety of aquatic plants and animals. 
It was a beautiful clear blue sky and we saw scores of pelicans, herons. As we were busy training our binoculars on them, I spotted a southern sea otter who was leisurely cruising on its back. Soon we saw several of them swimming together, rolling around in the water playfully and watching us right back. One of them was using a stone to crack open some shelled prey and devouring it, using its tummy as a dinner plate. Once it finished eating, it spent a few minutes rigorously cleaning its dense coat with its teeth and paws. Sea otters have the thickest fur of any animal and were hunted extensively for it. Elkhorn Slough has one of the largest resident colony of southern sea otters. 
Southern sea otters are considered as keystone species, as they play a crucial role in maintaining the health and balance of the marine ecosystems, particularly kelp forests. They help regulate the population of sea urchins, which can overgraze and destroy kelp forests, by preying on them. This helps to maintain the biodiversity of kelp forests and supports a wide variety of other marine life that rely on them. 
It was fascinating to watch the otters dipping, diving playfully. Seamus Heaney offers a wonderful description of them, in his poem ‘The Otter’:
“Turning to swim on your back,
Each silent, thigh-shaking kick
Re-tilting the light,
Heaving the cool at your neck.
And suddenly you're out,
Back again, intent as ever,
Heavy and frisky in your freshened pelt”

29/05/25, 9:23 am - Dr Raguram: Whenever I read Paul Lawrence Dunbar’s poem, "Sympathy", it leaves me deeply moved. The poet uses the symbol of a caged bird to voice his angst against societal oppression. The bird suffers from the “old, old scars” of past and it beats itself against its cage until its “blood is red on the cruel bars.” But in spite of it, it keeps singing. It is a song of pain.
No wonder this poem was the inspiration to Maya Angelou, to title her poignant autobiography, ‘I know why the caged bird sings.’ Among others, it is a searing account of her abuse and rape very early in life and ensuing trauma which cast a long shadow in her life. Angelou gave voice to countless survivors of sexual assault who, like her, endured years of trauma and silence. “Write so that perhaps people who hadn’t raped anybody yet might be discouraged, people who had might be informed, people who have not been raped might understand something, and people who have been raped might forgive themselves.” Her memoir powerfully conveys a message of resilience and revival, which she poetically refers as, “the honeycomb of determination”. Angelou also movingly describes the trials and tribulations of growing up as a black adolescent in a crushing climate of overt racism and inherent discrimination. 
The publication of this book paved way for countless women to feel inspired to narrate and share aspects of their lives that had long been shrouded in euphemism, secrecy, and shame.
Angelou summarizes her perspective succinctly, “My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humour, and some style.” 
(Maya Angelou 4 April 1928 - 28 May 2014)

30/05/25, 9:04 am - Dr Raguram: Every time I am in a jungle, I try to spot the dholes. They are interesting animals to watch. Often I see them in groups, sauntering around the jungle, till one of them spot a prey. Then it makes a call that is described as ‘whistle of the woods’, to draw the attention of the groups. Only once I saw them in action. The moment they spot a prey, they hunt as a pack, sealing off all the routes of escape. Once the prey is brought down, other members join in to eat the prey and they eat very quickly. They finish off in a few minutes, leave the kill in the open and wander away. In Nagarhole, we saw a vulture clean off the remnants with just the bones left behind.  
The term ‘Dholes’ originated from the ancient Asiatic origin; which means “reckless” or “daring”, and it does fit in with their unbridled, courageous behaviours. Dholes are considered as an endangered species in India and figure in the IUCN Red List. While we do not have exact population counts, experts believe there may be 4000-10,000 Dholes left in the wild, with only 1000-2000 adult individuals capable of reproducing. This decline is primarily attributed to habitat loss due to deforestation and fragmentation of forest corridors. 
"Red Dog" in Kipling's story is a literary character that embodies certain traits of the dhole. 
The poem reads;
“For our white and our excellent nights, for the nights of swift running,
Fair ranging, far seeing, good hunting, sure cunning!
For the smells of the dawning, untainted, ere dew has departed!
For the rush through the mist, and the quarry blind-started!
For the cry of our mates when the sambhur has wheeled and is standing at bay!
For the risk and the riot of night!
For the sleep at the lair-mouth by day!
It is met, and we go to the fight.
Bay! O bay!”
(28th May was the World Dhole Day!)

01/06/25, 10:32 am - Dr Raguram: A friend asked a question this morning as to why I didn’t post anything on the World Milk Day! In the process of getting to know about the history of milk production in India, I discovered that the history of dairy in the Indian subcontinent goes back roughly 8,000 years to the first domestication of zebu cattle, which is thought to have originated in India. By the beginning of the Indus Valley civilisation (c. 3300 – c. 1300 BCE), zebu cattle had been fully domesticated and used for their milk. They were known to produce dairy products, including milk. This is evidenced by the analysis of lipid residues on pottery shards from the Kotada Bhadli archaeological site in Gujarat. These analyses revealed the presence of milk-related lipids, suggesting the earliest direct evidence of dairy processing in the Indus Valley Civilization. The study also suggested that milk may have been boiled before consumption. There is also a suggestion that milk production may have been in surplus, potentially leading to trade and exchange between settlements. The majestic zebu bull, with its heavy dewlap and wide curving horns is perhaps the most impressive motif found on the Indus seals.

04/06/25, 9:22 am - Dr Raguram: During my early adolescent years, my uncle presented me with a BSA bicycle. I didn’t know how to ride one at that time. The task then, was to learn to ride it and in the process I fell down many a time and finally found the right balance to steer it. I often use this analogy in therapy to address the trauma and pain due to unfortunate tribulations in life which dawn upon us. These can unsettle us, but if we choose to, only briefly. The task is to unearth the emotional balance within, to navigate through the situation. The seeds for this perspective were sown through a painting of Claude Bernard outside our lecture theatre in JIPMER. Claude Bernard's concept of "milieu intérieur" meaning "internal environment" is a fundamental principle in physiology and medicine. It describes the body's ability to maintain a stable internal environment (homeostasis) despite external changes. Our task is to harness it, sometimes through external support and help. 
Another important learning curve for me when I started cycling was that the bicycle becomes a part of you. It merges with the rhythm of pedalling and the diktats of the driver. Personally it broadened my urban and inner landscape, much as outlined in ‘Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance’. Cycling is as close to flying, you feel free, your mind feels free and your spirits take flight. It was through cycling I discovered the nooks and corners of the city and its people. I took great pride in cleaning it meticulously and taking care of it, till I handed it over to my nephew.
There is a lovely quote attributed to Mehmet Murat ildan:
Four wheels move the body, Two wheels move the soul.
Every time you miss your childhood, ride on a bicycle!

05/06/25, 10:22 am - Dr Raguram: The Tamil Sangam poetry (circa 1st to 4th century CE) is a unique literary tradition among various streams of Indian literature. Devoid of mythological and religious allusions. It focused more on the environment and its impact on the individual. While the broad Sangam literature is generally categorized into akam (inner) and puram (outer), what is of great importance is that these two categories of poetry were painted on the ecological canvas of “tinais”. Tinais refer to five different environments; kurinji (mountainous regions), mullai (pastoral regions), marutham (riverine agricultural regions), neidhal (coastal regions) and palai (arid, desert regions). Sights and sounds of the environment is manifested in different locations like the mysterious mountain peaks, murmuring cool ponds and rivers, noisy sea shore, dry soulless desert land and rich agricultural pastures.
In Puranānūru 2, Poet Muranjiyur Mudinākanār writes;
மண் திணிந்த நிலனும்,
நிலன் ஏந்திய விசும்பும்,
விசும்பு தைவரு வளியும்,
வளித் தலைஇய தீயும்,
தீ முரணிய நீரும், என்றாங்கு
ஐம் பெரும் பூதத்து இயற்கை போல
These verses describe a king by comparing his nature to the five elements, “Your nature is like the five elements – the earth filled with sand,
the sky raised above the earth, wind that blows in the sky, fire that
sweeps up the wind, and water that contrasts from that fire.”
The poem draws attention to the intricate relationship between us and the environment we live in. It is imperative then to value and cherish this association.

06/06/25, 7:35 am - Dr Raguram: During my Commonwealth Fellowship at the University College London, one day I was walking around the college when I spotted an unusual seated figure in a glass cage. Curious, to know what the figure was, I enquired with my colleagues and was told that it is the preserved body of Jeremy Bentham known as the ‘auto icon.’ It consists of Bentham's skeleton dressed in his own clothes, with a wax head on top, as he requested in his will.  Bentham is often considered a spiritual founder of UCL, as he advocated for the general availability of education and was a prominent voice for utilitarianism, a philosophy that seeks to maximize happiness for the greatest number of people. 
Bentham’s philosophical orientation has been contentious, but he was an ardent advocate of women’s rights, freedom of expression and argued for the decriminalisation of homosexuality. He strongly believed that education should be accessible to all races and across all political beliefs. UCL was the first UK university to accept students regardless of gender, class or religion, pioneering a move towards inclusivity in higher education. Bentham was also a strong advocate of transparency and accountability in law and stressed the importance of public access to legal processes. 
Bentham’s work laid the foundation for the concept of ‘bounded reality.’ He drew attention as to how humans make decisions not based on perfect logic and complete information, but rather with limitations in their cognitive abilities, time constraints, and available information. He felt that limited recognition of available alternatives, incomplete knowledge of possible consequences, and imperfect anticipation of the values associated with future consequences often skews moral attitudes and the decision making processes. A concept that we witness being enacted around us all the time.

08/06/25, 10:05 am - Dr Raguram: Point Lobos State National Reserve in California is dramatically situated at the edge of the Pacific Ocean. It is often referred to as the “greatest meeting of land and water in the world”. Its rocky coastline offers a superb habitat for a huge diversity of plants animals and birds. Every time we visit the place, we feel mesmerized by its dramatic landscape. This enchanting landscape is a haven of tranquillity. At times one can hear the ocean's voice as a chorus of deafening roars when its powerful waves crash upon the rocks. But soon the waves start lapping gently against the rocks as if they are in a whispered conversation. 
As I was scanning the oceanscape, I noticed a groups of Brandt’s cormorants perched on the craggy surface of the rocks. They are the largest cormorants on the Pacific Coast. Brandt's cormorants are fascinating seabirds with unique diving abilities and can often dive deep to catch fish. They roost together as groups on rocks and forage in flocks. It was a fascinating sight when they suddenly took to the sky, flying in long lines over the rippling waters of the ocean. 
The Pacific Ocean in Point Lobos is a vast expanse mirroring the endless blue sky above, its surface a restless expanse of waves shimmering in sunlight. Watching it, I was reminded of a poem ‘Once By The Pacific’ by Robert Frost.
“The shattered water made a misty din.
Great waves looked over others coming in,
And thought of doing something to the shore
That water never did to land before.
The clouds were low and hairy in the skies,
Like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes.
You could not tell, and yet it looked as if
The shore was lucky in being backed by cliff,
The cliff in being backed by continent;
It looked as if a night of dark intent
Was coming, and not only a night, an age.
Someone had better be prepared for rage.
There would be more than ocean-water broken
Before God's last Put out the light was spoken.”

09/06/25, 9:15 am - Dr Raguram: All through history there have been narcissistic leaders., characterized by being unduly vain and conceited with an overwhelming sense of false pride. With their insatiable need for adoration, they seek attention and constant validation, often resorting to manipulation to maintain their image. One of the greatest example of it is the Roman emperor, Nero, who died on this date of suicide. Nero surrounded himself with sycophants who only told him what he wanted to hear. This environment stifled honest feedback, preventing him from confronting unpleasant truths. As a result, Nero's leadership became increasingly erratic, culminating in a series of disastrous decisions. His response to the Great Fire of Rome exemplifies his incompetence. Instead of uniting the people, he scapegoated Christians, initiating a wave of persecution that would last for centuries. 
More importantly, narcissistic leaders like Nero destabilize institutions, prioritizing personal ego over the common good. Throughout history many political leaders have traversed this territory with disastrous consequences in governance. There is an urgent need of leaders who embody virtue, courage and wisdom. Only then can we safeguard the institutions and freedoms we hold dear. 
Perhaps our leaders need to look back at people like Nero, learn and unlearn important lessons from history, to govern us with sensitivity and equanimity.

11/06/25, 9:02 am - Dr Raguram: We are all dreamers of dreams. Though it is a part of our real world experience, dream is also a window into our subconscious mind. Sometimes, our minds teeter on the edge of two worlds; the reality outside of us and the dreamscape within. In that state, we are neither fully immersed in the dreamscapes of our subconscious nor fully anchored in the rationality of waking life. Often it is a fertile breeding ground for deep reflection.
Zhuangzi, a foundational figure in Daoist philosophy, is famous for his parable of the butterfly dream. The story blurs the boundary between self and other. Zhuangzi wonders if he can truly know whether he is the dreamer or the dreamed, highlighting the limits of human understanding and the need to embrace uncertainty. He implies that life is a series of transformations, a constant flux of existence, wherein the distinction between the self and the other dissolves, leading to a newer level of awareness.  Zhuangzi’s uncertainty about whether he is the dreamer or the dreamed also draws our attention to the perennial question, what defines the self? 
In her travels in the wonderland, Alice had to confront this perennial question. She comes across a Caterpillar that is resting on top of a giant mushroom and smoking a hookah pipe. The two stare at each other in silence for a while before the Caterpillar asks Alice, “Who are you? This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, “I--I hardly know, sir, just at present-- at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.”
Both Zhuangzi and Lewis Carroll indicate that the concept of self is often fluid and dynamic. 
As Carl Rogers commented, "A person is a fluid process, not a fixed and static entity; a flowing river of change…continually changing constellation of potentialities".

16/06/25, 8:36 am - Dr Raguram: When we were in Wayanad a month ago, there was a prediction that the monsoon will arrive soon. Once we entered the Nagarhole forest, we were greeted with thousands of butterflies on their annual seasonal journey during pre-monsoon period. It was so wonderful to see them fluttering around in hordes. The raucous call of the peahen resonated across the forest.  I recalled that the word "Mylapore" in Chennai is derived from the Tamil phrase "Mayil ārpparikkum ūr," which translates to "land of the peacock scream." As we ventured further, a peacock flew in front of us, looked around for a while, and then began its elegant, dazzling dance. Slowly, it lifted its tail to form a semi-circular fan, which rippled in iridescent colours. I noticed that when they strum and flicker the feathers, strangely, the eyespots at the end seemed to remain relatively still. 
It is a commonly held belief that peacocks respond to the change of seasons and their dance heralds the arrival of monsoon. This has been one of the favourite subjects in Indian poetry. 
In the poetry of the Sangam era (300BCE-300CE), peacocks and the monsoon are often associated, with peacocks symbolizing the joy and vibrancy of the monsoon season. The monsoon is a time of renewal and abundance, and peacocks, known for their beauty and flamboyant display, are seen as messengers of its arrival. A lovely poem in Ainkurunooru; 492, states;
“நின்னே போலும் மஞ்ஞை ஆல நின்
நன்னுதல் நாறும் முல்லை மலர
நின்னே போல மா மருண்டு நோக்க
நின்னே உள்ளி வந்தனென்
நன்னுதல் அரிவை காரினும் விரைந்தே”
“When a peacock dances like you,
And fragrant jasmine blooms 
like the scent of your forehead,
When a doe gazes timidly like you,
I rush home thinking of you,
Swifter than a monsoon cloud.” 
In a 16th century poetic work, Mayurasandesa (The Peacock’s Message) written by Udaya in Malayalam, the poet writes, “In order to bring joy to the world, you dance, creating happiness. You, the descendant of Indira, offer solace to those in woe and brighten their world, much like the sun casting its rays on the lotus to bloom”.
In a beautiful poem, ‘New Rain’, Rabindranath Tagore writes;
“My heart dances today — dances like a peacock.
Like the shimmer of its plumes,
My heart glistens with rapturous colours.
When I see the sky, my longing loses itself in euphoria.
My heart dances today — dances like a peacock.”
The peacock’s brilliant hues as it dances does not merely reside in the pigment of its feathers but is due to refraction of light streaming through its plumage.  As I watched it, I wondered as to how important it will be for us to let the light of awareness permeate and transform our inner selves and set it aglow.

17/06/25, 10:01 am - Dr Raguram: The crocodile has had a strange relationship with the people of India. It has been both revered and feared, considered a protector and a menace.  It figures in puranas and in various mythological accounts. The most well-known mention about the crocodile is in Bhagavat Purana, as the legend of Gajendra Moksha. Gajendra, in his previous life as King Indradyumna, had neglected his duties and was cursed by Agastya to become an elephant. While fetching lotus flowers, he was seized by a crocodile and struggled to free himself, even trying to escape with his own strength for 1000 years. His friends and family also tried to help, but were unsuccessful. Finally, realizing his limitations, Gajendra prayed to Vishnu for help, offering a lotus flower as a symbol of devotion. Lord Vishnu, pleased with his prayer, appeared on Garuda and killed the crocodile, liberating Gajendra. 
There is an extraordinary depiction of this legend in Hoysaleshwar temple, Halebidu. Perhaps this is one of the most detailed depiction of the Gajendra Moksham. Vishnu is seated in Lalitasana and is holding an arrow, mace, and is Sudarshan Chakra. Garuda is carrying Vishnu and is covered with various ornaments. One can also see his wings on both sides. Bellow him, is the elephant struggling to survive. He is holding a lotus and presenting it to Vishnu. Under the right knee of Garuda, is the crocodile holding down the elephant in his killer jaws. 
The overarching message of Gajendra Moksham is a spiritual one, reminding us to prioritize the eternal connection with the divine over transient material pursuits. It encourages a deeper reflection on the impermanence of life and the importance of turning towards a higher power for solace and liberation from the cycle of suffering. 
As Srimat Bhagavatam states in verse 8.3.25

I do not wish to live anymore after I am released from the attack of the crocodile. What is the use of an elephant’s body covered externally and internally by ignorance? I simply desire eternal liberation from the covering of ignorance.

19/06/25, 8:29 am - Dr Raguram: We are in throes of yet another war. As missiles soar in the sky, screams fill the air and blood wets the ground, will the futility of war ever descend upon us all? I wonder. 
One of the most unsettling portrayal of war and its aftermath is a painting, ‘The Face of War’ by Salvador Dali. Dali was profoundly impacted by the events of the Spanish Civil War and World War II and he gave expression to his personal angst in his own unique way in this painting. It is a surrealistic portrayal of the impact of war on the human psyche. In this painting there is a disembodied, withered face, resembling a corpse, on the background of a barren, desert landscape. There is an unmistakable expression of fear, misery and agony on the face. The sockets of the eyes and mouth contain smaller faces which in turn have more faces within them, suggesting the infinite number of people who suffer the tragedy of war.  Swarming around the face are serpents, representing relentless attacks by malevolent forces. Dali left his handprint in the lower right corner of the canvas to convey that this painting came from his own deep agony about the impact of war. 
Whenever I see this painting, I can’t take my eyes off the haunting forms which are manifestations of the dread spawned by war. It is a chilling portrayal of the psychological trauma inflicted by the harshness of war. The wounds of battles are not merely physical. They leave behind craters smouldering with intense pain, unfathomable anguish and deep despair. As the world crumbles all around, the minds of people left behind after the war crumble too. 
As Aldous Huxley observed, "The most shocking fact about war is that its victims and its instruments are individual human beings, and that these individual beings are condemned by the monstrous conventions of politics to murder or be murdered in quarrels not their own."  
Amy Patterson, whose son returned from the war, deeply traumatized wrote these poignant lines in her poem, ‘A Mother’s Tear.’
“He screams in the night,
for the battle still roars,
as he lays in his bed,
he re-lives all the horror.
Nobody heard the fight,
he still fights,
except for his Mama,
who comforts him every night.
He never will be,
the son I once knew,
the war killed that part,
for freedom, for you.
Great Nation, Great Leaders,
and all those who will hear,
Freedom began
On a mother’s first tear.”

20/06/25, 8:41 am - Dr Raguram: When I think of the current war scenario, I am reminded of an Aesop fable, ‘Birds, The Beasts and The Bat.” 
The fable reads, “The Birds and the Beasts declared war against each other. No compromise was possible, and so they went at it tooth and claw. It is said the quarrel grew out of the persecution the race of Geese suffered at the teeth of the Fox family. The Beasts, too, had cause for fight. The Eagle was constantly pouncing on the Hare, and the Owl dined daily on Mice. It was a terrible battle. Many a Hare and many a Mouse died. Chickens and Geese fell by the score—and the victor always stopped for a feast. Now the Bat family had not openly joined either side. They were a very politic race. So when they saw the Birds getting the better of it, they were Birds for all there was in it. But when the tide of battle turned, they immediately sided with the Beasts. When the battle was over, the conduct of the Bats was discussed at the peace conference. Such deceit was unpardonable, and Birds and Beasts made common cause to drive out the Bats. And since then the Bat family hides in dark towers and deserted ruins, flying out only in the night.”
The fable highlights the problems associated with trying to remain neutral in a conflict. If one constantly switches allegiances, it can lead to losing the trust and support from either side. The bat's attempts to benefit from both sides ultimately results in him having no friends or allies." 
“A Beast he would be, or a bird,
As might suit, thought the Bat: but he erred.
When the battle was done,
He found that no one
Would take him for friend at his word.”

20/06/25, 7:38 pm - Nalini N R: Yes Sir. Anchoring is very important. Otherwise we get carried away in this uncertain world. It is a beautiful photograph!
20/06/25, 7:56 pm - Nalini N R: One of the horrible depictions of war. And the mother's anguish. Life is so harsh, innocents suffer, most will not even know the intricacies of politics.
20/06/25, 8:25 pm - Nalini N R: Very apt for the current scenario. The bats went into a hiding but the country is shameless and will continue to repeat the flaw.

24/06/25, 8:57 am - Dr Raguram: I used to make frequent forays into the Moore Market in Chennai (till it was burnt down) in search of books. Often I would find books by authors whom I had never heard of. During one such visit I picked up Ambrose Bierce’s ‘Devils Dictionary’ and ‘Selected Stories.’ The former was fun to read. Bierce’s humorous and satirical definitions of common words were quite engaging. The stories were markedly different. Frequent themes in his stories were about the horrors of war, which is best exemplified in a short story ‘Chickamauga.’ It seems so relevant to retell this tale now.
In this story which is set during the American Civil War, a six-year old child in Georgia wanders into the forest carrying a wooden toy sword playing a game as a soldier. Soon he is lost in the woods and sleeps off. When he wakes up, he is frightened by a strange moving object which at first he cannot identify. He fears it might be another wild animal like a dog, pig, or bear. He then realizes that this is not one creature, but many creatures, one followed by another. He finally realizes that these are hundreds of soldiers, creeping on their hands and knees instead of walking. He places himself in the lead and directs the march of the crawling, staggering soldiers. As they march ahead, the child sees a building on fire. When he goes near, he discovers that it is his own home and to his great shock also perceives his mother who has suffered a gruesome death. The author now reveals that the child who is deaf and mute, utters a series of inarticulate and indescribable cries when brought face to face with the horrific reality of war closer home. 
Bierce describes in graphic detail, the battlefield which is littered with the wounded who drag themselves through the mud and the dying who are left unattended. The child is totally oblivious to the destruction and suffering around and he even rides on a gravely wounded soldier. For the child it is akin to a war game as he “places himself in the lead, his wooden sword still in hand, and solemnly directs the march.” Bierce is deftly alluding to the fact that generals and politicians who lead men into wars are like this deaf child, who has little understanding of what he is doing. Reality doesn’t dawn on the child until he sees his burning home and his dead mother. That is when the horror of war becomes a reality to him. 
There was a real Battle of Chickamauga in which more than 40,000 people lost their lives. It was the second costliest battle of the Civil War, ranking only behind Gettysburg and was by far the deadliest battle ever fought in the nation. It is rather disquieting then, when the country that has witnessed such human tragedy is groping its way across yet another foreign locale, hardly learning from scores of its misadventures in the past. In Bierce’s words, the boy was committing “the common enough military error of pushing the pursuit to a dangerous extreme.”

25/06/25, 10:53 am - Dr Raguram: I first heard the Beatles way back in 1975: it was the album, ‘Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.’ I had never heard anything like it before. I was mesmerized by its unique instrumentation, the harmonic tones and the lovely vocals. I’ve heard this album so many times and find something new every time I hear the songs. The album left a lasting impression on me and I was hooked to the Beatles. Over a course of time, Ahalya and myself started collecting their albums and these vinyl records have a special place in our home. Their repertoire is vast and stunning, from love songs to deeply reflective, introspective lyrics which explore themes of loneliness like in ‘Eleanor Rigby.’  To me their songs are sheer poetry. For instance, the song, “She’s Leaving Home” stands out as one of their loveliest and saddest songs. It is like a short story in a musical form, narrating the plight of a young girl who feels unloved at home: ‘She’s leaving home after living alone for so many years’, to embark on a journey to find solace with her new companion. Each of their albums is a creative gem to cherish. 
Like me, Murakami also seems to have had an abiding love for the Beatles. It seeps through many of his works. There is a short story titled ‘Yesterday’ and another one titled, ‘With The Beatles’, in which narrator's fondest memories is of a girl he encounters in the school corridor, clutching an LP of “With The Beatles”. I am particularly fond of his novel whose title is based on a Beatle song, ‘Norwegian Wood’ from the album ‘Rubber Soul.’ The novel begins with the main protagonist, Toru Watanabe, arriving at Hamburg Airport while the Beatles’ song “Norwegian Wood” is playing on the speakers. The song’s opening line (“I once had a girl, or should I say she once had me.”) succinctly captures the melancholic tone in the relationship of the two main characters Toru and Naoko. There is beautiful part in the novel when Toru asks, “What happens when people open their hearts?” and Reiko responds, “They get better.” And the Beatles achieve this seamlessly in their songs. 
(It was on 25th June that the Beatles participated in the BBC show ‘Our World’ in 1967, performing, “All You Need Is Love” to an international audience which is  now commemorated as the World Beatles Day).

27/06/25, 1:01 pm - Nalini N R: Never had time to listen carefully, understand the lyrics. It is so true but not realised for a very long time in life!

30/06/25, 12:19 pm - Nalini N R: A very sad story and the worst part is history is repeating itself. The leaders are not only deaf and mute but inhuman. I read a post about the elephants in Thailand where they are so intelligent and empathetic towards their caretaker creating a shield like a canopy to protect her from rains. In what way humans are more intelligent and civilized?
30/06/25, 12:26 pm - Nalini N R: A very mature way of handling relationships and death. I feel it comes out of harnessing the mind, understand life and very important to decondition.
30/06/25, 12:47 pm - Nalini N R: Such a beautiful colourful tiny bird which appears so focused in its job. The poet has wonderfully described the bird, its flight and the way it procures honey!

May be our body language and eyes convey what we feel and definitely that helps in therapeutic relationship. I could see empathy in your eyes Sir!
05/07/25, 12:21 pm - Nalini N R: She was an ardent devotee, follower of Lord Jesus who helped even financially his ministry. The painting looks so realistic portraying her deep, unmatchable devotion to the Lord. Mira Bai and Akka mahadevi had to face the ire of people. I wonder what happens with the opposite gender when they express the 'love' for a female diety....

07/07/25, 9:46 am - Dr Raguram: Whenever I course along the Big Sur, I am reminded of authors, artists and spiritual seekers who had made this pristine stretch their creative abode. I had written sometime back about Jack Kerouac who wrote his novel, ‘Big Sur’ in a cabin under the picturesque Bixby Creek Bridge. Another author who found a sanctuary there was Henry Miller. I have read many of his novels, including his controversial novel, ‘The Tropic of Cancer.’ But one work of his which left a lasting impression on me is the ‘The Air-Conditioned Nightmare.’ 
The book is a travelogue of his journey across US in the 40s. When I re-read it now many of his observations ring so true about the nation. He finds USA, vapid and soulless, a nation of people who are a “vulgar, pushing mob whose passions are easily mobilized by demagogues, newspaper men, religious quacks, agitators and such like. To call this a society of free peoples is blasphemous. What have we to offer the world beside the superabundant loot which we recklessly plunder from the earth under the maniacal delusion that this insane activity represents progress and enlightenment?” 
At times he may sound like a grumpy old man, feeling a deep sense of disquiet observing a nation where giant industries which pollute the environment and are impervious to the lives of their workers, and a population entrapped in a fast web of material comforts and relentless mass consumerism. He finds the people totally unaware of the world outside who, “bludgeon one another with facts and theories gleaned from cursory readings of newspapers, magazines, and digests.” He observes the giant, corporate American who is “seated in a comfortable chair in New York, Chicago or San Francisco, a man surrounded by every luxury and yet paralyzed with fear and anxiety, controls the lives and destinies of thousands of men and women whom he has never seen, whom he never wishes to see and whose fate he is thoroughly uninterested in.” Writing in 1940s, he laments, ‘The world meanwhile looks to us with a desperation such as it has never known before. Where is the democratic spirit? Where are the leaders?”
Even though his narration might sound bleak, he notices a nation “still intact, like a piece of music which goes on being played forever. The instruments wear out, and the players too, but the notes are eternal, and you are made of nothing but invisible notes which even the faintest zephyr can shake a tune out of.”
